Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) has established a Registered Testing Pool (ADS RTP) and a Domestic Testing Pool (ADS DTP) to ensure the effective implementation, coordination, administration and enforcement of the ADS testing programme.

Athletes in the ADS RTP and the ADS DTP, and any other athlete, who meets ADS' definition of athlete under the ADS Anti-Doping Policy, can be subject to both in-competition and out-of-competition doping control tests.

An athlete who has been identified for inclusion in either the ADS RTP or ADS DTP will be notified by ADS directly or through their National Sports Association (NSA).  ADS shall in consultation with the respective NSA, identify possible athlete(s) for inclusion into the ADS RTP or ADS DTP based on the criteria listed below. However, ADS shall have the final decision and shall not discuss the reasons for including a particular athlete or athletes into either testing pool.

**CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION INTO THE ADS RTP OR ADS DTP**

Inclusion in the ADS RTP is based on a number of factors related to the athlete and the sport. These may include: 

* Athletes already included in their International Federation's Registered Testing Pool
* Possible performance-enhancing effect that doping may elicit on the sport
* Available doping analysis statistics of sports and disciplines
* Available research on doping trends
* International competition(s) for the year that is of significance to Singapore
* Serving periods of ineligibility or provisional suspensions as a result of Anti-Doping Rule Violations
* Reinstatement after period of ineligibility
* Coming into or out of retirement
* Injury
* Independent athlete(s) based locally or internationally who are selected for representation at major international events
* Return from international training stints of at least 3 months
* Unexpected and significant improvement in sporting performance
* Training with Athlete Support Personnel previously associated with doping practices
* Behaviour indicating doping
* Persistent last-minute changing of Whereabouts Information
* Athlete sport performance history
* Details of past doping controls
* Reliable information from a third party

The ADS DTP will comprise mostly athletes who are in national squads and who are not in the ADS RTP. The factors for inclusion in the ADS DTP may include:

*   Possible performance enhancing effect that doping may elicit on the sport
*   Available doping analysis statistics of sports and disciplines
*   Available research on doping trends
*   International competition(s) for the year that is of significance to Singapore

#### **RETIREMENT AND REINSTATEMENT**

**Retirement**

Athletes in the ADS RTP or ADS DTP who wish to retire from competition, should notify both their NSA and ADS by completing the [ADS Athlete Retirement Notification Form](/anti-doping-singapore/resources/polices-and-forms) and submitting it to their NSA and ADS.

Athletes are required to complete the sample collection process if ADS has not received the ADS Athlete Retirement Notification Form. Failure to comply with the request to provide a sample could result in an Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV).

Any athlete on their International Federation's RTP will also be subject to the International Federation's retirement requirements. Athletes are to contact their respective International Federation for more information.

**Reinstatement**

Athletes must ensure they follow the reinstatement procedures as set out in the [ADS Anti-Doping Rules](/anti-doping-singapore/resources/polices-and-forms) and their International Federation's Anti-Doping Policy, if applicable.

Athletes who have given notice of retirement to ADS and their NSA may only resume competition unless they notify ADS and their NSA at least 6 months before returning to competition and avail themselves to unannounced out-of-competition testing at any time during the period before actual return to competition. Notification of their return to competition should be given to ADS and their NSA using the [ADS Athlete Return to Competition Notification Form](/anti-doping-singapore/resources/polices-and-forms).

Any athlete in an International Federation's RTP will also be subject to their International Federation's reinstatement requirements.

When an athlete retires while serving a period of ineligibility, the clock stops on the period of ineligibility. If the athlete wishes to be reinstated, the athlete will need to:

* wait out either the remaining period of ineligibility or the reinstatement period, whichever is longer; and
* be subject to out-of-competition testing.
