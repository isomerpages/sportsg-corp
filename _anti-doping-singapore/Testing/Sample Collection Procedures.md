The following is a general overview of the doping control process. Departures from these procedures will not invalidate a test result unless it is determined that the integrity of the sample has been compromised.

**STEP 1: ATHLETE SELECTION:**
You can be selected for doping control at any time and any place without advance notice and are subject to random and planned selection methods

**STEP 2: NOTIFICATION:**
A Doping Control Officer (DCO) or Chaperone will notify you of selection for doping control to provide either a urine sample, blood sample or both. You are required to present a photo identification to confirm your identity. The DCO or Chaperone will inform you of your rights and responsibilities. You will be asked to sign the Doping Control Notification form confirming that you have been notified for doping control. A copy of the form will be provided to you for your record. You may also request an athlete representative to accompany you throughout the doping control process

**STEP 3: REPORTING TO THE DOPING CONTROL STATION**
You are required to report to the doping control station immediately unless you request a delay in reporting for valid reasons. Please visit the [Rights and Responsibilities](/anti-doping-singapore/testing/rights-and-responsibilities) section for more information. The DCO or Chaperone will accompany you from the time of notification until the completion of the sample collection process.

At the doping control station, you will be given a chance to hydrate. Individually sealed beverage will be available.
