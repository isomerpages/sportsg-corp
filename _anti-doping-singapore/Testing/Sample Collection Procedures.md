The following is a general overview of the doping control process. Departures from these procedures will not invalidate a test result unless it is determined that the integrity of the sample has been compromised.

**STEP 1: ATHLETE SELECTION:**
You can be selected for doping control at any time and any place without advance notice and are subject to random and planned selection methods

**STEP 2: NOTIFICATION:**
A Doping Control Officer (DCO) or Chaperone will notify you of selection for doping control to provide either a urine sample, blood sample or both. You are required to present a photo identification to confirm your identity. The DCO or Chaperone will inform you of your rights and responsibilities. You will be asked to sign the Doping Control Notification form confirming that you have been notified for doping control. A copy of the form will be provided to you for your record. You may also request an athlete representative to accompany you throughout the doping control process

**STEP 3: REPORTING TO THE DOPING CONTROL STATION**
You are required to report to the doping control station immediately unless you request a delay in reporting for valid reasons. Please visit the [Rights and Responsibilities](/anti-doping-singapore/testing/rights-and-responsibilities) section for more information. The DCO or Chaperone will accompany you from the time of notification until the completion of the sample collection process.

At the doping control station, you will be given a chance to hydrate. Individually sealed beverage will be available.

**STEP 4: SELECTION OF A URINE COLLECTION VESSEL**
You are given a choice of at least 3 individually sealed sample collection kits, and you will select one. You should verify that the equipment is intact and has not been tampered with. You should maintain control of the collection vessel at all times.

**STEP 5: PROVIDING THE URINE / BLOOD SAMPLE**
![step5](/images/What%20We%20Do/Anti%20Doping%20Singapore/Testing/Sample%20Collection%20Procedures/step5.jpeg)
Only you and a DCO or Chaperone of the same gender are permitted in the washroom when you provide the urine sample. The first urine sample that you are able to provide following notification must be collected.

Minors and athletes with a disability must have their representative present. The representative is not permitted to view the sample provision, but to ensure that the DCO or Chaperone is observing the sample provision correctly. The representative will not witness you providing the sample unless you specifically request them or require their assistance.

Before providing the urine sample, you are required to wash your hands with water, remove any clothing from the knees to the mid-torso and from the hands to the elbows. This provides the DCO or Chaperone with a direct view of the urine leaving your body and into the collection vessel.
You are responsible for controlling your sample and keeping it in view of the DCO or Chaperone until it is sealed in a sample collection kit.

If you provide a sample less than theÂ required volume of 90ml, you are required to temporarily seal it and wait until you are ready to provide more urine until the minimum volume is attained.

**PROVIDING THE BLOOD SAMPLE**

Prior to providing a blood sample, the Blood Collection Officer (BCO) or DCO must ensure that you have been seated and relaxed for at least 10 minutes. If a blood sample is being collected for the Athlete Biological Passport, you must have been rested for at least 2 hours.

When providing a blood sample, you will be asked to select from at least 3 sets of blood collection kits, blood sample storage and transportation kits. Checks should be made to ensure they are empty, clean and the seal is intact.

A trained BCO will perform the blood collection procedure in the presence of a DCO or Chaperone and, if applicable, the athlete representative.

The BCO shall assess the most suitable vein for sample collection and clean the site. They will then unseal the hypodermic needle and attach the vaccutainers (self-sealing secure containers) and withdraw blood to fill the required number of tubes. No more than 3 attempts will be made per session.

**STEP 6: SELECTION OF A URINE SAMPLE COLLECTION KIT**
You are given a choice of at least 3 individually sealed sample collection kits from which to choose one. You should verify that the equipment is intact and has not been tampered with. You will open the kit and confirm that the sample code numbers on the bottles, the lids, and the container all match. Also verify that the bottles are intact and has not been tampered with.
