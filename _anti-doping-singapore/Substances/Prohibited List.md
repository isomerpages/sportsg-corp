The List of Prohibited Substances and Methods, updated annually by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), is the International Standard defining what is prohibited In-Competition and Out-of-Competition. The List also indicates whether particular substances are banned in particular sports. WADA reviews and updates the List annually and the most current edition of the List is posted on WADA's website at: [www.wada-ama.org](http://www.wada-ama.org/) . The updated Prohibited List comes into effect on 1 January every year. 

For easier access, the List is now available on the various mobile devices and platforms. Visit the Prohibited List [mobile site](http://list.wada-ama.org/) or download the application for iPhones.

**PRINCIPLE OF STRICT LIABILITY**
Athletes should know that, under the Code, they are strictly liable whenever a prohibited substance is found in their urine or blood sample. This means that a violation occurs whether or not the athlete intentionally, knowingly or unknowingly, used a prohibited substance or was negligent or otherwise at fault. It is therefore very important for athletes to understand not only what is prohibited, but also what might potentially cause an inadvertent doping violation.

Athletes should always check with their International Federation or Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) to find out what additional substances and methods are prohibited in their sport.  Athletes should always make their doctor aware that they are athletes and about using drugs in the List. Those who are unsure of what a product contains should not take it until they are sure it is not prohibited. Ignorance is never an excuse.

**MEDICAL CONDITIONS**

Athletes, like anyone, may at times experience a medical condition that requires them to use particular medicines.  The substances that an athlete may be required to take to treat a condition could fall under the List. However, by applying and obtaining a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) from your International Federation or ADS, an athlete may be allowed to take the necessary medicine.

Athletes who need to apply for a TUE should request more information about the TUE application process from their International Federation (for international-level athletes) or ADS (for national-level athletes). For information about applying for a TUE from ADS, please refer to the [Therapeutic Use Exemption](/anti-doping-singapore/substances/therapeutic-use-exemption/) section.

**CHECKING MEDICATION**

Athletes can check if the medication is a Prohibited Substance or the method of treatment is a Prohibited Method under the List by one of the following ways:

1.  Anti-Doping Singapore's (ADS) Check Drugs Database  - 
    For list of medications registered in Singapore  
    
2.  [Global Drug Reference Online](http://www.globaldro.com/)  - For list of medications registered in Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the USA and Switzerland  
      
3.  [Hong Kong Anti-Doping Committee's Drug in Sport](http://www.druginsport.hk/) - For list of medications registered in Hong Kong
    
4.  [Irish Pharmacy's Drug in Sport Database](http://www.eirpharm.com/) (endorsed by the Irish Sports Council) - For list of medications registered in Ireland

**TIPS FOR ATHLETES TRAVELLING ABROAD**

Athletes planning to travel abroad are advised to:

* Take enough medication to continue any treatment for the duration of the trip   
* Check the medication is permitted in the country of travel and whether it is permitted to bring through customs

Any products purchased overseas should be carefully checked. The ingredients in common medications can and do contain different substances to those available in Singapore.

Some countries have different customs laws that may prohibit the import of certain substances into a particular country. Athletes carrying a prohibited substance for a legitimate medical condition, should carry the following documents at all times:

* The prescription from the prescribing doctor including the name of the substance, the dose and the frequency of use   
* The TUE Certificate to demonstrate that an authorised anti-doping organisation has permitted the use of a prohibited substance for medical purposes
