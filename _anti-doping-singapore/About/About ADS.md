The Government of Singapore was a signatory to the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport in 2003 and had also adopted the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport in 2005 by accession, thereby formally recognizing Singapore's commitment to implement the [World Anti-Doping Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/world-anti-doping-program/world-anti-doping-code) ("WAD Code").

Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) was established in 2010 by the then Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports as the national anti-doping authority for Singapore, and is a division within the Singapore Sports Council (rebranded as "Sport Singapore" or "SportSG" with effect from 1 April 2014) responsible for the implementation and management of the Anti-Doping Programme for sport in Singapore.

ADS' primary responsibilities are to:

* Plan, coordinate and implement an effective doping control programme;
* Advocate doping-free sport in Singapore through education programmes;
* Monitor National Sports Associations for their compliance with the Anti-Doping Policy of Singapore, the ADS Anti-Doping Rules, and the WADA Code;
* Pursue all potential anti-doping rule violations within its jurisdiction;
* Encourage reciprocal testing between national anti-doping organisations; and
* Promote anti-doping research.
 
ADS' mission is to ensure sport in Singapore is free of doping through the implementation of effective education, detection, research and international co-operation initiatives.

Every Singaporean athlete is a True Winner.
