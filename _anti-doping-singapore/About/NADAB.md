The Singapore Sports Council (rebranded as "Sport Singapore" or "SportSG" with effect from 1 April 2014) appointed the National Anti-Doping Advisory Board (NADAB) to advise the SportSG and Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) on all anti-doping matters.

The NADAB is represented by members with expertise in the following areas:

In carrying out its responsibilities, the NADAB shall:

* Matters related to the World Anti-Doping Code (“Code”) compliance and the National Compliance Platform under the UNESCO
