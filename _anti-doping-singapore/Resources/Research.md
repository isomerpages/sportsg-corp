Understanding the fundamental differences between athletes who choose to compete clean and those who resort to doping or why some athletes decided to dope will help ensure doping prevention strategies are effective and efficient.  
  
The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA's) Social Science Research Grant Program was created to ensure that preventive anti-doping education programs were designed using an evidence-based approach.   
  
Annual research grant funding of between USD 20,000 to USD 65,000 are available to organisations keen on research projects that can contribute to doping prevention.
