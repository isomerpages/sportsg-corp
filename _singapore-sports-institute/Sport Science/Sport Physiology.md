The Sport Physiology Unit is responsible for evaluating the physical and physiological characteristics that contribute to athletic performance. We oversee the planning and delivery of sport physiology services for our athletes and coaches so as to achieve higher levels of sporting excellence. 

Our sport physiologists study and evaluate our athletes’ acute responses and chronic adaptations to their athletic training both in the laboratory and on the field. This knowledge enables them to introduce training interventions to accelerate our athletes’ recovery after training or competition.

Another key function of the unit is to assist coaches in the monitoring of training workloads for their athletes.   
  

The Sport Physiology Unit also engages in applied and sports-specific research.  

The services available at the Human Performance Laboratory include:

* Individual consultations
* Sports-specific physical and physiological testing
* Monitoring of training
* Training interventions
* Workshops for athletes
