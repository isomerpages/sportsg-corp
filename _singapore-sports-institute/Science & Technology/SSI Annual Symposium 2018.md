#### **SSI ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM 2018**

##### **About the SSI Symposium**

This year’s Singapore Sport Science Symposium is held together with the ASIA (Associations of Sports Institutes in Asia) Congress where member countries such as Japan, Qatar, Hong Kong and Singapore will come together for its Annual General Meeting and Congress with the aim of enhancing the future of high performance sport in Asia. The theme for the Congress is ‘Sport Integrity’.

Organized by the Singapore Sport Institute (SSI), the theme for the first two days of the Singapore Sport Science symposium is ‘From Youth to Elite Sport – Harnessing Potential and the Pursuit of Excellence’. It builds on from 2017’s focus on biomechanics and physiology to mental well-being and recovery this year. The symposium will provide sport administrators, practitioners, educators, coaches and students opportunities to engage in conversations on bio-psychosocial, environmental and contextual factors that contribute to youth athlete development, and the utility of various sport science and medicine disciplines to prepare elite athletes holistically.
