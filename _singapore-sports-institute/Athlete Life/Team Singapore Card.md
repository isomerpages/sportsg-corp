Singapore Sport Institute collaborates with corporate companies and retail outlets to provide various forms of privileged discounts and incentives for the benefits of Team Singapore Athletes, in supporting them to achieve excellence in their sporting journey.  
  
On 13 January 2016, Singapore Sport Institute launched the Team Singapore Card for Team Singapore Athletes.  
  
The Team Singapore rewards card was subsequently made available via the ActiveSG app as an electronic card (e-Card) to all newly carded and Major Games athletes from July 2019.
