#### **Muhammad Jaris Goh Ali Akbar Goh – Team Singapore Bowler**

**Graduate of NITEC in Fitness Training, Institute of Technical Education**

After completing his ‘N’ Levels, Jaris went on to pursue the NITEC in Fitness Training with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). He successfully obtained a GPA of 3.625 and was named the Valedictorian, ultimately leading him to further his education through pursuing the customised RP-SSP DSLM Programme.  
  
ITE has supported Jaris in allowing him to train and compete through providing:  

*   Flexible academic scheduling which allowed him to compete overseas
*   A mentor to guide him in his education plans
*   Additional make-up classes whenever he is back from competitions
*   Leave of absence for overseas training and competition stints

> “It was tough as at ITE. Luckily I had good support from the school and friends who were always there to help me with my schoolwork whenever I missed classes. The support allowed me to focus on my studies and bowling, providing me with the opportunity to fulfil my dream of pursuing the customised RP-SSP DSLM course and bowl at my highest potential.” - Muhammad Jaris Goh, Team Singapore Bowler

**Diploma in Sports and Leisure Management, Republic Polytechnic**

Shanti graduated from the Singapore Sports School in 2012 and went on to pursue the customized RP-SSP DSLM programme with Republic Polytechnic.

Republic Polytechnic has supported Shanti in allowing her to train and compete through providing:

*   A customised class schedule which allows Shanti to train twice a day 
*   A flexible academic load allowing her to take deferment of modules so as to train full-time towards major games
*   A mentor to provide education and career guidance to help in the concurrent pursuit of sports and academic excellence

> “If it weren't for the flexible academic pathway offered, the coaches I was under and the staff who guided me, I wouldn't have been able to make to where I am today, including winning the 200m gold at the Singapore 2015 Southeast Asian Games. That was the ultimate breakthrough in my running career and I could not have done it without the well-balanced support that the Sports School and Republic Polytechnic had provided me with.” -  Shanti Veronica Pereira, Team Singapore Track & Field Athlete
