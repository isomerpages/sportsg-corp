**SportCares** was established in 2012 as the philanthropic arm of SportSG to enable vulnerable individuals and persons with disabilities to experience and reap the benefits of sport by instilling confidence and elevating oneâ€™s outlook on life.

In addition, SportCares cultivates a spirit of sport philanthropy among corporates and community partners. Find out how SportCares is changing lives through sport [here](https://sportcares.sportsingapore.gov.sg/).
