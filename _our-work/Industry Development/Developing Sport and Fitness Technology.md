<p>We are spearheading efforts to create a hub for sports technology innovation,
focusing on developing a thriving ecosystem that drives sustainable growth
and technological advancements in the sports industry. Key initiatives
include the Enterprise Innovation and Capability Development Grant (InnoGrant),
which offers funding of up to S$1 million per project, and the building
of a repository of industry problem statements. By fostering innovations
in the sport and fitness sector, the team is working to make Singapore
an ideal partner in the global sports technology and business marketplace,
actively seeking collaborations to co-create innovative solutions for enjoying
and participating in sports.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, we are committed to ongoing support for sports
technology through programmes like the InnoGrant, emphasising the creation
of a robust ecosystem that nurtures startups, businesses, and institutes
of higher education in developing sports tech innovations. We are exploring
new technologies to enhance sporting experiences, improve performance,
and increase participation, while also seeking opportunities for international
partnerships and the expansion of locally developed technologies to global
markets. Through these efforts we are working towards its vision of inspiring
the national spirit and transforming Singapore through sport, with the
ultimate goal of helping people live better through sport.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Problem Statements</strong>
</p>
<p>Discover key industry problem statements that highlight real challenges
and opportunities for innovation and connect with leaders who are actively
seeking solutions to overcome them.</p>
<p>In collaboration with key industry players like the Global Sport Innovation
Center, SportSG kickstarted the initiative to gather industry problem statements
in 2023 to identify needs in the sport and fitness industry and bridge
the gap between real-world challenges and innovative solutions. This initiative
is also a strategic effort to catalyse innovation and foster collaboration
between technology providers and various industry players.</p>
<p>This platform serves to facilitate ongoing collaboration between problem
statement owners and solution providers, accelerate the adoption of cutting-edge
technologies, provide increased visibility for local innovators to engage
with international corporations, and nurture a dynamic ecosystem for sport
and fitness technology innovation. Through this initiative, SportSG and
our industry partners continue to drive meaningful partnerships, foster
economic growth, and solidify Singapore's position as a hub for innovation
in sport and fitness.</p>
