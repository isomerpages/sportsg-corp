<h3><strong>Major Events</strong></h3>
<p>Singapore has established itself as a premier destination for world-class
sporting events, offering a diverse range of experiences for both participants
and spectators, while providing our national athletes opportunities to
compete against the best in the world.</p>
<p>SportSG's approach to sports events is deeply rooted in the national vision.
Aligned with ForwardSG's six pillars, particularly the "Unite" pillar,
SportSG aims to strengthen social cohesion, promote inclusiveness, and
build national identity through sport. These efforts are guided by the
Singapore Sports Masterplan – Vision 2030, which focuses on developing
both mass participation and high-performance sports to create a thriving
sports ecosystem.</p>
<p>The<strong> Major Sports Events Fund (MSEF) </strong>plays a crucial role
in this process, supporting the hosting of world-class sporting events
with two primary goals: providing opportunities for the community to enjoy
top-tier sporting action, and increasing participation opportunities for
both the community and established and budding national athletes.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Singapore is set to host the SEA Games in 2029,
building on the success and national unity fostered during the 2015 edition.
The country continues to invest in its event hosting capabilities, constantly
seeking new ways to present sporting events that capture the imagination.
This growth opens exciting opportunities for brands to connect with sporting
audiences in innovative ways. Singapore actively invites partners to collaborate
in rethinking event presentation, aiming to create unforgettable experiences
that resonate both locally and globally.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Major Sports Event Fund (MSEF)&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The Major Sports Events Fund (MSEF) is a cornerstone initiative in Singapore's
strategy to establish itself as a premier destination for world-class sporting
events. Launched by SportSG, this S$165 million fund, allocated over four
years, aims to attract, support, and promote major international sporting
events in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MSEF's objectives are multifaceted:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancing Singapore's Global Sports Profile</strong>: By attracting
high-profile international events, the MSEF helps position Singapore as
a world-class destination for sports, enhancing its reputation on the global
stage.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Boosting Local Sports Participation</strong>: The fund aims to
inspire Singaporeans and residents to engage more actively in sports by
providing them with opportunities to witness world-class sporting action
firsthand.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Supporting National Athletes</strong>: MSEF-backed events offer
valuable opportunities for Singapore's national athletes to compete at
the highest levels on home ground, contributing to their development and
performance.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Driving Economic Benefits</strong>: Major sporting events attract
international visitors, stimulate tourism, and generate economic activity
across various sectors, from hospitality to retail.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>Fostering Innovation in Event Hosting</strong>: The fund encourages
the exploration of new event formats, including virtual and hybrid events,
positioning Singapore at the forefront of sports event innovation.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>Since its implementation, the MSEF has played a key role in fuelling the
growth of Singapore's sporting landscape and is one of the several factors
contributing to the 30% increase in sports, entertainment, and lifestyle
event days in 2023 compared to pre-COVID levels in 2019. Notable achievements
include hosting the inaugural Olympic Esports Week in 2023 and creating
the Urban Sports &amp; Fitness Festival, which attracted over 70,000 participants
in its first year.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MSEF is not merely a funding mechanism but a catalyst for Singapore's
vision of becoming a global sports hub, playing a crucial role in shaping
Singapore’s sporting future and its position on the world stage.&nbsp;</p>
