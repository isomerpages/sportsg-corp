**Active Health** aims to support Singaporeans' journey towards better health with guided expert knowledge backed by science.

Standing by its belief that “Better Beats Perfect”, Active Health believes that making a big impact on one’s health hinges on forming small habits in our daily lives. Active Health labs managed by qualified specialists, a mobile app to track your fitness progress conveniently, and fun community activities are available for participants to start building these routines and tracking their progress. Active Health focuses on four domains: physical activity, nutrition, screen time, and sleep.
