The professional development of coaches is a key focus area of Vision 2030. In 2014, SportSG commissioned a study of the demographics of Singapore's coaches to better understand the industry's profile, wants, and needs. With the benefit of these insights, SportSG designed a concept of an 'academy' for coaches in 2015, and officially launched CoachSG in May 2017 with a first-ever coaching conference.

**CoachSG** serves as a key lever to coaches' successes by recognising coaches as critical force multipliers in sport and aspiring to codify positive sport experiences. It ensures coaching competency by establishing quality pathways and initiatives for holistic coach development.
