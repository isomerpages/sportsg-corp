Sport Singapore recognises the importance of R&D in promoting the application of science and technology (S&T) in sports to provide athletes with the edge for podium success in international games.   
  
The S&T plans will be driven through a dedicated R&D funding mechanism that will invest in R&D programmes to harness the broader S&T capabilities in Singapore for application in Sports and Coaching performance.   
  
The end-state is to develop the application of S&T as part of a holistic solution and deliver integrated, state-of-the-art S&T capabilities to support the performance of our Team Singapore coaches and athletes.
