At the Singapore Sport Institute (SSI), we believe in empowering athletes to make a difference. The Athlete Life Department delivers the 'Athlete Life Management' (ALM) programme, which is about integrating sports performance with all key aspects of an athlete's life for holistic development - to make that difference in their lives and that of others.

We seek to help our athletes achieve their sporting aspirations together with other life goals. By integrating the demands of high-performance sports with ALM, we prepare the athlete for a successful sports career and life after competitive sports.

ALM has three main components: Athlete Life Coaching, spexEducation and spexBusiness
