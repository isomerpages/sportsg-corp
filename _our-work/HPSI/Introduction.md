<p>On 1 April 2025, the Singapore Sport Institute and the National Youth
Sports Institute merged to establish the High Performance Sport Institute
(HPSI) under Sport Singapore (SportSG).
<br>
<br>This consolidation aims to advance Singapore's sporting excellence, achieve
consistent podium success in regional and international competitions, and
inspire and unite the nation through Team Singapore athletes' journeys
and performances.
<br>
<br>HPSI will lead a unified high-performance sport system, supporting Team
Singapore athletes in reaching their full potential. The institute will
provide comprehensive support throughout their sporting careers, ensuring
a seamless progression from youth to senior levels. Through these efforts,
HPSI aims to establish sport as a sustainable long-term career and encourage
athletes to extend their participation in competitive sport.
<br>
<br>Another key focus of HPSI will be to deepen partnerships with National
Sports Associations. This collaboration will enhance athlete and pathway
development, foster greater alignment within the sporting ecosystem, and
uplift capabilities and professionalism in the sport industry.
<br>
<br>Through these efforts, HPSI aims to create a robust framework for nurturing
and supporting Singapore's athletic talent. The institute's work will ultimately
contribute to the nation's sporting success on the global stage, while
inspiring future generations of Singaporean athletes.</p>
