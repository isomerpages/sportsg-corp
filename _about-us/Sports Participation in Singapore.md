**Measuring Sports Participation in Singapore**  
  
For every five years since 1987, Sport Singapore has provided the sole indicator of local sports culture through the National Sports Participation Survey (NSPS), a Singapore-wide study conducted among Singapore citizens and permanent residents who are at least 13 years old.  
  
With a sample size of 9,000, subgroup analyses beyond participation level (e.g. female participants vs. female non-participants) can be drawn from the NSPS results, for a better understanding of the different attitudes and behaviours toward sports.  
  
In between the NSPS years, a smaller-scale study called “Sports Index” was deployed primarily to supply Sport Singapore more timely insights into the sporting trends and needs of the Singapore consumer. With the growing demand for more updated information among external stakeholders, key highlights from the Sports Index will also now be more accessible to the public.
