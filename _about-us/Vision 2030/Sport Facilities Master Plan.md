<p>The Sports Facilities Master Plan (SFMP) is a key recommendation under
the Vision 2030 sports master plan, to provide greater access to quality,
affordable sports facilities and enable wider participation in sports.
It provides the physical foundation for sports in Singapore, enables our
sports talents to pursue excellence and creates common spaces for people
to interact, bond and rally around Team Singapore.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>When the implementation of the Masterplan is complete, a majority of Singaporeans
will have easy and convenient access to a new generation of sports and
recreational facilities that will enable wider participation in sports.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The first phase of the Masterplan will include a mix of new facilities
as well as a rejuvenation of the existing ones, with innovative new features.&nbsp;</p>
