<p>As our society evolves with the influx of new ideas and priorities, we
must address these trends in how we create space for sports in Singapore.
The Sports Facilities Master Plan (SFMP), a key recommendation under the
Vision 2030 sports master plan, aims to provide greater access to quality,
affordable sports facilities and enable wider participation in sport. As
part of the SFMP, SportSG will continue to develop and rejuvenate quality
infrastructure to cater to the diverse and evolving sporting needs, interests
and aspirations of Singapore's population. Our aim is to provide Singaporeans
with innovative, accessible, affordable and relevant sports facilities,
with a majority within a 10-minute walk from their homes by around 2030
– creating a network of quality sporting facilities in our heartlands.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Masterplan will include a mix of new facilities
as well as a rejuvenation of the existing ones, with innovative new features</p>
<p>New facilities to be built include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A new Regional Sport Centre in Punggol that will cater to a wider range
of competitive sports and events and will be integrated with Punggol's
waterways and co-located with the SAFRA clubhouse. This new Regional Sport
Centre will be able to host sports activities and events for the community
of Punggol.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>At the community level, new sports and recreational facilities are developed
in the neighbourhood as part of the Sport-in-Precinct (SIP) programme.
These SIP facilities are located conveniently within HDB estates and offer
a range of amenities including sheltered multi-purpose courts, playground
and fitness corners. With ten SIP facilities completed, Singaporeans can
look forward to more such facilities such as the ones at Whampoa and Mountbatten,
thereby bringing new sporting spaces closer to residents.</p>
