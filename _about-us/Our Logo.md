The Sport Singapore brand is about empowering people to live better through sport and helping to bring sport into the lives of all Singaporeans. This is the inspiration behind the brand design.

The positive upward spiral of the Sport Singapore 'sphere' symbolises the fullness of life that sport brings to people of all ages and abilities. The colour bands symbolise the diversity of people and the wide spectrum of ways that sport benefits all Singaporeans, transcending boundaries and expressing the partnerships and community building that sport represents.

The colour palette is anchored on red, reflecting the passion for sport and the potential for harnessing sport in nation building. The robust italicised font gives the overall brand identity a confident, future-ready expression that is relatable by all.
