<p>Our Sport Nutrition team recognises that food isn’t just a recipe for
health, but the key ingredient to supporting peak performance. They appreciate
the amazing qualities of food and strive to elevate Team Singapore through
translating evidence-based science into practice with athletes, coaches,
and National Sporting Associations.</p>
<p>Our Sport Nutrition team adopts a “Food-First” approach for all athletes,
which prioritises whole foods over supplements. As compared to highly refined
supplements, foods contain a wider variety of beneficial nutrients that
promote the health and performance of athletes. Where appropriate, the
team educates athletes on safe and proven supplement use to gain a competitive
edge. Refer the <a href="/files/Our Work/Singapore Sports Institute/Athlete Life/SSI_NYSI_Joint_Supplement_Policy_16_June_2020_FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Joint Policy on supplement intake</a> for
HPSI (drafted by Singapore Sport Institute and National Youth Sport Institute).</p>
<p>A major task of our Sport Dietitians is educating athletes on nutrition
strategies to optimise training adaptations and achieve peak performance
through proper fueling and recovery across their training cycle. This is
necessary as nutritional needs vary according to training phases, and helping
athletes and coaches understand this is a key first step. The team also
works with athletes to improve sleep and advise on travel nutrition to
ensure that they are properly fueled on the go.</p>
<p>On top of professional development to keep updated on scientific developments
in nutrition, the team also conducts research and collaborates with local
and overseas universities to identify cutting-edge science suitable for
use with our athletes.</p>
