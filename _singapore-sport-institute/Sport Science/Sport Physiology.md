<p>Sport Physiology focuses on understanding the physical demands of competition
in a particular sport, and subsequently working with the coach to design
training programs which help the athlete reach peak physical condition
in the most important competitions. These physical demands are mostly dependent
on the characteristics of the sport (e.g. distance, duration), as well
as the competition structure (how many rounds/matches) and the prevailing
environmental conditions (esp. heat and humidity) which can have a direct
impact on athlete work capacity. The type, amount and timing of training
can all be manipulated to produce the most appropriate adaptations leading
to sport specific fitness and maximal performance.</p>
<p>Our Sport Physiology team aims to ensure that athletes get the most effective
outcomes from the effort they put into training. This can be done through
routine monitoring of training load together with regular testing, to assess
the response to training and inform subsequent training priorities. Specific
environmental interventions can not only improve work capacity but also
help in familiarising athletes with the conditions they will likely encounter
at Major Games.</p>
<p>If training is the Yin, then recovery is the Yang, and the two work hand-in-hand
to ensure athletes are not only very FIT, but also feeling very FRESH,
when they compete in major competitions. Accordingly, our Sport Physiologists
assist in providing effective recovery activities at appropriate phases
of the training plan.</p>
<p>Lastly, in always looking for a competitive edge, our Sport Physiologists
explore evidence-based interventions and conduct research on novel techniques
aimed at maximising athlete performance.</p>
