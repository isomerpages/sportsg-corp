The Biomechanics Unit is responsible for optimising athletes’ sports-specific technique to improve performance and prevent injury.

**What is it?**

Biomechanics is the study of an athlete’s technique relative to an ideal model or performance target.

Our professionals use mathematical modelling and computer simulation to assess performance. 
Biomechanical analysis allows us to to construct  sensible training targets by addressing the underlying hindrances to attaining athletic goals.

**What Biomechanics Unit does?**

Our Sport Biomechanics Laboratory offers the following services:
* Motion and technique analysis of physical skills
* Consultations to identify technique faults and improve performance
* Performance analysis using notational analysis (based on advanced match or event statistics) and specialist video editing
* Development of sports-specific biomechanical measurement devices
* Educational workshops and discussions on biomechanics
