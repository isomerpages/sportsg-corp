The Major Games Preparation Unit works to enhance our athletes' performance and recovery at the four major games:Â 

* Southeast Asian Games
* Commonwealth Games
* Asian Games
* Olympic Games

Through advance planning and real-time involvement, we minimise the distraction and stress of our athletes during games time, enabling them to focus on their performance.

To prepare for the major games, the Singapore National Olympic Council and the Sport Singapore collaborate to deliver:

* High-performance preparation plans
* High-performance and major games preparation workshops
* Performance analysis
* Major games secretariat functions to coordinate on-site operations
* Enhanced sport medicine and sports science (SMSS) support
