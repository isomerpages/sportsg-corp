<p>Sport psychology contributes to enhancing performance, developing, and
maintaining athletes’ well-being, and promoting recovery within the competitive
sports environment. Our Sport Psychology team provides coaches, athletes,
and teams with comprehensive, holistic, and evidence-based psychology support
to empower every individual to achieve peak performance.</p>
<p>In helping our athletes to constantly maintain a competitive edge in training
and competitions, our sport psychologists explore evidence-based interventions
and conduct applied sport psychology research aimed at helping athletes
to maximize their performance. Working closely with the coaches towards
building a solid team culture that includes goals, values, attitudes, and
beliefs is also critical to the work that we do with our athletes.</p>
<p>Our Sport Psychology team aims to ensure that our athletes are well supported
and empowered with strategies even outside their sporting environments.
This is done by equipping our athletes with an understanding of their psychological
functioning and helping them to build their ability to employ a range of
psychological strategies to thrive under pressure. By journeying through
the Mind Inspire, Mind Gym and Mind Grow spaces, the team also aims to
create a safe environment for our athletes and coaches to feel inspired
and committed towards learning, reflect about mental excellence, and challenges
them to take action.</p>
