<p><strong>The Singapore Sport Science &amp; Technology Research Grant (SSSTRG)</strong> is
an initiative of Sport Singapore through the Singapore Sport Institute
(SSI) which aims to support multidisciplinary sports R&amp;D for capability
development and for supporting Team Singapore athletes and coaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More specifically, the purpose of the SSSTRG is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build capability and capacity for sports-related science, medicine and
technology research in Singapore;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote training of young scientists in the area of sports-related science,
technology and innovation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harness national science and technology capabilities for smart solutioning
to achieve success for Team Singapore athletes and coaches; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage and stimulate collaborative research.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Through the SSSTRG, the research findings and practical applications should
be harnessed to enhance performance of athletes, advance Singapore’s sports
science, technology and innovation and produce high quality publications
for knowledge generation and the training of specialists in the domain
of sports-related R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Sport Singapore is the SSSTRG grant agency and SSI will be the executing
arm for the grant.</p>
