**What We Do**

In accordance with the “Research involving Human Subject: Guidelines for IRBs” released by the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) in November 2004, SSI-IRB was formalised in 2012 to safeguard the rights, welfare and safety of human research subjects involved in SSI’s research programmes.
