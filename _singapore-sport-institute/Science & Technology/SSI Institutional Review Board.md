<p><strong>What We Do</strong>
</p>
<p>In accordance with the “Research involving Human Subject: Guidelines for

of human research subjects involved in SSI’s research programmes. The SSI-IRB
is also compliant to the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/others/health-regulation/regulation-of-human-biomedical-research" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Health’s Human Biomedical Research</a> (HBR)
