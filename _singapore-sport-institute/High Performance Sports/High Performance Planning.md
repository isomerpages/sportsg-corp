<p>The High Performance Sport System aims to provide the best support to
Team Singapore athletes so that they can fulfil their sporting aspirations
and to inspire the Singapore Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Periodisation Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>A key element of the High Performance Sports system is the periodisation
programme, which drives training and competition profiles over a four-year
Olympic cycle. These training cycles take into consideration the interphases
between an athlete’s peak performance and recovery periods to achieve their
optimal performance at the right time, without the consequences of overtraining.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that it remains a holistic system to develop athletes
for podium success, other elements of athlete development are integrated
into the periodisation programme, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Performance tracking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports science and medicine intervention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education and career planning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our team also act as system managers during this process to ensure the
best outcome for our athletes.</p>
<p>Sport Excellence Carding (<em>spex</em>Carding)</p>
<p><em>spex</em>Carding is the entry point into the national sports development
system.</p>
<p>All athletes must be nominated by their respective National Sports Associations
(NSAs) before they will be allowed into the national sports development
system.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Achievements:</strong>
</p>
<p>Consideration for High-Performance Sports pathway support is based on
the athlete’s profile / potential to achieve at the Major games or its
equivalent. Performance is assessed based on the athlete’s holistic achievement
profile and not on just a single point of achievement during the assessment
period.</p>
<p><strong>Sport Excellence Scholarship (<em>spex</em>Scholarship) and Sport Excellence Potential (<em>spex</em>Potential) Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>The <em>spex</em>Scholarship and the <em>spex</em>Potential programmes provide
an enhanced level of support for athletes within the High Performance Sports
(HPS) pathway. These include both financial and programmatic support to
prepare athletes to excel at the Major Games. In addition to developing
athletes' sporting potential, both programmes will also assist athletes
in their education, career, and personal development.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we aim to develop athletes to take on leadership roles in
their respective communities, serving as role models for Singapore's youth.</p>
<p><strong>Nominations</strong>
</p>
<p>Each year, the <em>spex</em>Scholarship is open to nominations by any NSA.
For FY 2025, the nomination period is from 16 September 2024 to 16 October
