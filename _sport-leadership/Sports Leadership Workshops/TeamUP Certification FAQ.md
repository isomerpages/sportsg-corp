#### **TeamUP Certification Programme Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**What is TeamUP Certification Programme?**

TeamUP Certification Programme has its origins from the training that was developed to prepare sports coaches to conduct [ActiveSG TeamUP](https://www.myactivesg.com/read/2017/3/upping-the-game-in-team-building). The certification programme includes 2 modules (Module 1 & Module 2) that will lead to certification and provide job opportunities for coaches either as ActiveSG Assistant Coaches or ActiveSG TeamUP Coaches.

**Who is entitled for the subsidized rate?**

Only NROC coaches are entitled for the subsidized rate at $25.00 (incl. GST) upon agreement to fullfill a subsidy requirement. 

**How does the Subsidy Requirement work?**

The Subsidized rate is $25.00 (incl. GST) while the full rate is $667.60 (incl. GST).  This requirement is put in place as the subsidized rate is a small fraction of the original rate and aims to also provide further learning opportunities for coaches. The Subsidy arrangement includes a volunteering requirement to conduct x2 sessions of ActiveSG TeamUP as a TeamUP Assistant Coach for Module 1 and TeamUP Coach for Module 2 (where applicable). Through the conduct of the 2 sessions, coaches will get to enjoy a more holistic learning experience where they get to apply what they learnt in the programme in a real coaching environment, receive feedback on their application and also learn from more experienced TeamUP Coaches. 

**What happens if I do not fulfill the Subsidy Requirement?** 

In the event that coaches are unable to complete the requirements within 1 year from the date of completion of Module 1 or 2 due to their unavailability, coaches will be expected to pay the difference between the full rate and the subsidized rate of $642.60 (incl. GST) upon request. 

**What is Module 1?**

Module 1 is a Continuing Coach Education (CCE) programme over 2 half days (5hrs each) that focuses on helping coaches to understand how to build more effective teams. Coaches will learn team development models and facilitation skills that will enable them to understand the intricacies of team dynamics to encourage team effectiveness in achieving team goals.

**What is next after Module 1?**

Coaches who are interested to be part of the pool of ActiveSG TeamUP Assistant Coaches can opt in for a summative assessment. The summative assessment includes an online submission and oral questioning to assess the coach's competency as an ActiveSG Assistant Coach. Upon completion of the summative assessment and deemed as competent, the coach would also be eligible for Module 2. If a coach chooses to stop (exit the certification pathway) after Module 1, he/she will accumulate 10 CCE hrs without need to go through the summative assessment. 

Please take note that eligibility to attend module 2 is only upon completion of the subsidy requirement (Voluntary requirement to conduct x2 sessions as an ActiveSG Assistant Coach)

**What is Module 2?**

Module 2 provides training for coaches to be ready to conduct ActiveSG TeamUP as TeamUP Coaches over 2 half days (5hrs each). Coaches will learn in more details how to facilitate learnings from sport back to the work environment such as facilitating reflective conversations. There is a summative assessment at the end of Module 2 to assess coaches competency in achieving ActiveSG TeamUP Programme outcomes. A coach who is certified as competent will be able to conduct ActiveSG TeamUP as a TeamUP Coach.
