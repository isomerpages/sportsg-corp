Using the 25 Stories
--------------------

Reflection is known and have been commonly used in sporting teams for coaches to go through performance during trainings and competitions, to allow athletes to better understand errors made during trainings and competitions and on how to improve it. Coaches will evaluate, gather and disseminate feedback and get athletes to reflect on their individual development.  
  
There are many different methods to conduct a reflection session. One of which is through the use of stories. Storytelling as a reflective tool has been used in many areas such as higher education, children education and also in sport settings. The use of story-telling as a method could help coaches to deal with unexpected situations and consider the possibilities for what could have happened as well as what actually transpired. Coaches can then apply knowledge from past stories to new situations to help athletes or the team make sense of them. Stories can also be used to inspire valuable lessons and values in athletes as it is often used to invite deeper thought and reflection on larger issues. It also helps coaches to educate their athletes on issues well beyond the sporting arena.  
  
We believe that sport is not just about technical ability and skill, but rather, a reflection of more complex attitudes and value systems in our lives.
