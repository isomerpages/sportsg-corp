##### **Game for Life Mentoring Programme**

Participants who wish to take a step further in their development as a values-driven coach after the GFL practical workshop can consider signing up for the GFL mentoring programme. 

The programme is anchored on Sport Singapore’s Game-for-Life (GFL) framework as the approach for the intentional design of sport for character development (CLDS). Mentoring is a key feature of this programme whereby interested coaches will be matched to an experienced mentor to guide them over a period of about 4 months on effectively layering the affective domain as part of their coaching process before being assessed for their competency.
