Schools do NOT need to raise Direct Purchase Orders (DPOs) to the vendors from the SEP Vendor List.

Schools shall call an open ITQ (Invitation To Quote) via GeBIZ. Under this ITQ, schools shall also invite Sports Providers with endorsed SEP programmes to participate if the SEP Grant will be utilised.

**Q [School]** Can I used Edusave and other forms of school funds to pay for the remaining 50% of the programme cost?
<br>
**A** Yes. Schools may use the Edusave Grant, Edusave Pupils’ Fund, School Operating Fund or other school funds to pay for the cost not covered by the grant. They have to comply with prevailing regulations governing the use of funds from these sources.

**Q [School]** How do i claim for the funds used for SEP?
<br>
**A** (a) For Government and Government-aided schools: 
Schools will need to charge 50% of claimable expenses to IFAAS Project Code 500042 (SSC-SEP Grant) while the remaining 50% of the payment has to be borne by schools.

**Q [School]** Can my school use a vendor that is not a SEP endorsed programme provider and claim for 50% of cost from the SEP grant?
<br>
**A** No, the SEP grant can only be used to engage providers who supply endorsed programmes under SEP. If a vendor you know is not in the endorsed list, you may like to inform them to register online for a login account, so that they can be informed of how to apply for endorsement for the next year.
