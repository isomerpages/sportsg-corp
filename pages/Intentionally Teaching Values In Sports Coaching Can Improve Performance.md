During National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI) community of practice sharing session, netball coaches were introduced to the idea of intentionally teaching values to youths during sports activities and training.

Using a structured approach to deliberately encourage and reinforce values and behaviours in sports coaching is still uncommon. And while values such as perseverance and resilience are invariably inculcated during training sessions, it is often an inadvertent by-product of training. 

_“Actually, as all the coaches have mentioned, we have been doing it in all our training sessions, but we didn’t notice,”_ said Ong Chin Chin, netball coach of CHIJ St Nicholas Primary and Secondary Schools.

_**“So now, I try to make it more specific and intentional. And I realised it is good to bring it out intentionally. The girls will remember it.”**_

By using the **[Game For Life (GFL) framework](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Sports-Education/Sports-Leadership/Game-For-Life/Guide)** that **[CoachSG](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Athletes-Coaches/CoachSG)** has developed, Ong is currently trialling this novel method of teaching sports with her charges at St Nicholas. 

One key aspect of the GFL framework is for the instructor to take action to deliberately reinforce desired behaviour and values.

And she has seen **positive reception from her players** by using this method of positive reinforcement. 

*“Last time, I would tend to just tell them the things they would be doing. But when I gave credit to positive behaviour, the girl was very happy and the team was clapping,”_ she said. _“I realised the girls love it.”*
