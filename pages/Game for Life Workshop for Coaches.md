The bi-annual Game-for-Life (GFL) workshop organised by CoachSG’s Character & Leadership Development (CLD) Team saw 30 coaches from multiple sports coming together to learn about intentionally designing values into training sessions. The workshop was conducted by Mr. Gobinathan Nair, who also lecturer for the Values & Principles in Sport Course, & presently Director-General, SEA Regional Anti-doping Organisation.  

The experiential workshop took the coaches through a series of practical activities that allowed coaches to experience a floorball training session infused with values conducted by Gobi, and Ranald Joseph, who is the strength and conditioning coach of the men’s national floorball team.

This was followed by addressing coaches’ challenges on teaching values, and understanding the GFL framework as a structured approach to infuse values within training sessions. The session ended with the coaches getting the opportunity to design & deliver sport activities based on the GFL training template.
