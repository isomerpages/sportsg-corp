Sports Providers offering NROC Sports will need to have their instructors/coaches registered under the National Registry of Coaches (NROC). During the two-year endorsement period, instructors/coaches will also be invited to attend clinics, workshops, and conferences as part of the NROC requirement on continuing education (CCE).  
  
For application details on NROC, please visit NROC Registration. Sports Service Providers are strongly advised to inform your coaches and instructors to obtain regular updates and information from the [Coaches page](/support-resources/activesg-programme-partnership/nroc-sports/).

**2. OTHER SPORTS**  

**a. National Coaching Accreditation Programme (NCAP) Technical Equivalent**

Sports service providers will be required to submit your coaches’ relevant technical certificate equivalent if your coaches are not equipped with NCAP Technical Level 1.

**b. NCAP / SG-Coach Theory Courses**

Coaches and instructors will be required to complete either the NCAP Theory or SG-Coach Theory course. The SG-Coach Programme replaces the NCAP. As all existing NCAP certificates remain valid, obtaining accreditation from NCAP to SG-Coach is not required.

**c. NCAP / SG-Coach Theory Accreditation** If your coaches are not equipped with NCAP / SG-Coach Theory, but have other prior learning, experience or certification, you may seek NCAP / SG-Coach Theory Accreditation. The accreditation level depends on evidence of prior learning. To seek NCAP / SG-Coach Theory Accreditation, please:

*   Complete the [NCAP / SG-Coach Theory Accreditation Form](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/-/media/SSC/Corporate/Files/Athletes-and-Coaches/For-Coaches/Coach-Development/National-Coaching-Accreditation-Programme/20180719-SGCoach-Theory-Accreditation-Application-Form.ashx?la=en&hash=E3076157AAF8669D0CE73A42F9CFF6F9D41BE130)
*   Attach evidence of your relevant documentary proof of prior learning, e.g. academic / coaching certificates, transcripts and brief course descriptions, evidence of coaching experience (letters of appreciation, coaching awards, etc.)

\*The NCAP / SG-Coach Theory accreditation process would take up to 4 weeks. For enquiries, please email [sport\_coaching@sport.gov.sg](mailto:sport_coaching@sport.gov.sg?subject=Sports%20Education%20Programme "null") 

**3\. VALUES AND PRINCIPLES IN SPORTS (VPS)**

With effect from March 2015, the National Standards for Youth Sports (NSYS) workshops will be replaced by the Values and Principles in Sports (VPS) workshops.

Apart from covering key content from the previous NSYS course, the new VPS workshop will also enable participants to develop their own personal coaching philosophies, design sports programmes with the ‘Game of Life’ Framework and leverage values and attributes in the development of a successful sports team.

Please take note that attendees of the previously offered ‘NSYS for Coaching in Singapore Schools” (NSYS) workshop are deemed to have fulfilled Ministry of Education’s (MOE) requirements for registration of all sports coaches and instructors in schools and they do not need to attend the new VPS workshop. For coaches who had completed modules 1-3 in the previous NSYS, they will be required to sign up for a bridging workshop with MOE on the fourth module in order to fulfill MOE’s requirements.    

The new VPS workshop is one of the six topics under the Singapore Coach Excellence (SG-Coach) Theory Level One Programme and exemption of attendance from VPS can be sought. You may click [here](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/athletes-coaches/coaches-corner/singapore-coach-excellence-programme-sg-coach) to find out more information on the SG-Coach Programmes.

For registration and more information on the VPS workshop, please visit the [VPS page](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/sports-education/values-and-principles-in-sports).
