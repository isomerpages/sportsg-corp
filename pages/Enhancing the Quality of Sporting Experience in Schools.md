 **“Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality” – Warren Bennis**

While students and teachers were busy with mid-year exams in the month of May, Sport CCA Coaches & Teachers from Evergreen and St. Hilda’s Secondary school were busy crafting the possibilities to translate the visions for their school sports teams into reality. These schools have taken the first step to recognise that it takes a much more deliberate and integrated effort between school leaders, teachers, and coaches to foster a positive school sports culture, that would in turn facilitate the effective character development of student athletes.

Led by CoachSG’s Character & Leadership Development (CLD) Team, the first series of leadership development workshops brought together Sports CCA Coaches and Teachers as a collective community, to build a shared vision and commitment towards creating a culture that would enhance the quality of sporting experiences in their respective schools.
