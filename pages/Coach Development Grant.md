#### **Coach Development Grant**

**Coach Development Grant (CDG) Scheme Details**

<hr>

#### **Section 1: Introduction**

The Coach Development Grant (CDG) provides financial assistance to individual sports coaches who wish to upgrade their coaching knowledge and skills via attending coaching attachments, conferences, short-term courses, workshops and seminars as well as obtaining a Degree or Diploma, both locally and overseas.

All learning activities covered by this grant will be known as ‘CDG Activity’ in subsequent sections.

SportSG will review the application and deliberate on the actual grant amount for each application. **Please note that SportSG reserves the final right on the funding decision.**

Through CDG, SportSG aims to build ongoing partnerships with individual CDG recipients. Through this partnership, CDG recipients will have the opportunity to:

a. Help develop other sports coaches professionally

b. Be invited to share their sports coaching stories, knowledge, experience, and insights at CoachSG’s selected platforms (e.g., CoachSG Conference)

**Section 2: CDG Overview**

CoachSG aims to support as many coaches as possible in their professional development journey through CDG. Hence, we encourage each applicant to submit a maximum of 2 applications per Financial Year (FY). If an applicant submits a 3rd application within the same FY, CoachSG will prioritise funding allocation for applicants with 2 or less applications within the same FY.
