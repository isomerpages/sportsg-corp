**Evergreen Secondary School (EVGSS) reaps benefits through Game For Life framework**

In 2012, Evergreen Secondary School (EVGSS) partnered Sport Singapore (SportSG) to implement the Game For Life (GFL) framework in the physical education (P.E.) curriculum. The teachers have found GFL to be beneficial and have shared the use of the framework with other schools since 2013. They have also been advocates of SportSG’s continuing work in the GFL framework which has reached out to 158 schools till date.

The GFL framework, developed by SportSG, features the use of game activities and specific role-playing that helps in the learning and development of character, which in turns enhances the sporting experience for every individual. 

“Game For Life has helped bring the code of conduct alive as it enhances our current way of doing things,” said P.E. and rugby teacher-in-charge Mr. Adam Arif Chan, who incorporated the framework in the school’s rugby training programme.

“Usually, at the start of a training session, the coaches and teachers would emphasise one value that we wish to inculcate. During the drills, we look out for teachable moments and demonstrate to the players how they have translated that value into action. During the debrief session, we would affirm the players who had demonstrated the value and celebrate positive moments caught during the practice.”

Today, EVGSS is closer to achieving their target of zero disciplinary issues. The greatest affirmation was during the National School Games in 2014, when their student Ariffin bin Mohd Ali was awarded the Fair Play Award for his sportsmanship during a match. The Fair Play Award recognises positive demonstration of character in sport.

EVGSS has conducted seven sharing sessions on the GFL framework with P.E. teachers from other schools, sharing knowledge and good practices to create optimal sporting experiences and achieve effective learning outcomes. Over 4 years, more than 30 schools have attended workshops conducted by the school and gleaned insights to help them integrate the framework in their existing P.E. programmes. 

According to EVGSS’ principal Mrs. Lim, the professionalism and profile of the P.E. teachers in the school have improved. Other teachers look upon them as educators with a robust pedagogical approach to their P.E. lessons. They are happy that the GFL framework has contributed to the effectiveness of their Character and Leadership Development through Sport programme.

It was only natural that when the school wanted to learn from an organisation for their school-wide visioning and work planning, they approached SportSG for assistance. To ensure a rich learning experience for EVGSS, SportSG developed a learning journey that encompassed a tour of its office and Sports Hub facilities and a sharing session by SportSG’s management and staff, including how strategies such as Vision 2030 were conceived and operationalised on the ground.

Moving forward, EVGSS will be collaborating with SportSG on a new project - Character and Leadership Development through Sport Community of Practice (CoP). The project gathers schools that are implementing similar character development frameworks to share their best practices, to improve affective learning through sport to proliferate the value of sport among educators and the community in Singapore.
