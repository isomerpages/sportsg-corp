The second module of the ActiveSG’s Leaders Through Sport (LTS) Programme was held from 4 September to 6 September 2017. The overnight camp comprised of students from 6 secondary schools – Pei Hwa, Bedok South, Pasir Ris, Geylang Methodist, Green View, and Evergreen, plus nominated participants from Beyond Social Services. LTS provides students with a unique opportunity to develop leadership skills while using sport as a platform to bring out teachable moments unique to the sporting arena.

Activities were designed to challenge the students to step out of their comfort zone, which saw students having to plan and execute their own sports tournament & festival within half a day with peers whom they have not worked with before. Outdoor elements were also introduced through a night amazing race around Pasir Ris and raft building.

“I’ve twice attended leadership programs, but this is the first time that I am attending one with a sporting element,” said Irfan Nasri, a 16-year old participant from De Yi Secondary School, who was connected to the workshop via Beyond Social Services. 

“It’s a 3-in-1 workshop here. I get to play and organize sports, I learn about leadership, and I become a better person through it all! As chairman of my group, I enjoy the challenges that come with my position, and understand that every decision has outcomes that I have to deal with, good or bad. I have also learned to multi-task as a leader as I am chairman of 3 groups – groups 2,9 and 12.”

ActiveSG facilitator Fu Yong said, “Having worked with the Eliza & Ee Theng from CoachSG on the design of this programme since January, it’s fulfilling to see all our work coming to fruition in the form of the participants enjoying themselves and learning from the LTS Programme,” 

“Team sports bring out enthusiasm and emotions that often tend to be suppressed in other settings of these kids’ lives. Sports help bring them out of the comfort zone and into the learning zone. We see the kids picking up useful teamwork skills when organizing their own games, and seeing how much their ideas appeal to the rest.”

“We hope to see these kids come back as facilitators for the LTS Programme someday!”
