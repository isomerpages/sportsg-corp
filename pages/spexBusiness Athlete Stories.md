<p>Success Stories from Team Singapore Athletes</p>
<h5><strong>Kacy Lim, Team Singapore Athlete (Water Polo)</strong></h5>
<p>Meet Kacy Lim, a dedicated Team Singapore (TeamSG) Water Polo player who
recently participated at the Malaysia Milo Invitation Age Group Championships
in Kuala Lumpur. With aspirations to surpass SEA competitors, especially
Thailand, Kacy and her team mates work together, constantly pushing one
another to new heights. However, all these achievements did not come easily
as Kacy had to juggle her extensive water polo trainings and overseas competitions
while gaining meaningful job experiences outside of sports.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“I had a hard time finding an internship role with time flexibility, and one that can allow me to take time off for my overseas competitions,” </em>Kacy
remarked. Fortunately, Kacy’s journey to finding flexible internships that
accommodate her rigorous training and competition schedule was greatly
facilitated by the <em>spex</em>Business programme. She discovered this
invaluable resource as she has been receiving numerous emails from the
team on athlete-friendly job opportunities. After failed attempts to secure
internships with companies that can support her sporting pursuits. Kacy
decided to reach out to the <em>spex</em>Business team. &nbsp;Since then,
she has received unwavering support from the team, who were instrumental
in refining her resume and providing continuous guidance throughout the
internship sourcing process.</p>
<p>Kacy’s first internship, secured through <em>spex</em>Business, was with
Under Armour (UA) as a Merchandising Intern. UA’s internship initiative,
called the Rookie Programme, offers a unique experience with paid opportunities
globally for students across various majors to dive into real-world projects,
collaborate with industry experts, and immerse themselves in the UA brand.
Through the team’s recommendation and Kacy’s capabilities showcased during
the interview, the UA team decided to take on Kacy for the role. As a merchandising
intern, Kacy coordinated shipment tracking, created purchase orders, and
supported regional demand planning. A standout experience for her was attending
the UA trade show in Thailand, a rare opportunity for an intern. UA fostered
an engaging environment where Kacy built lasting relationships, developed
valuable skills, and thrived.</p>

</div>
<p><em>"Kacy's dedication and adaptability made her an asset to our team. Her involvement in the trade show exemplified her commitment to learning and growth,"</em> said
Saniyah,&nbsp;Manager, Planning at Under Armour.</p>
<p>With her positive experience working with the <em>spex</em>Business team,
Kacy reached out to the team again to look for another internship with
another athlete-friendly company to expose herself to a variety of roles
and experiences. With the team’s assistance, Kacy is currently interning
with Fujifilm Business Innovation Singapore (FBSG) as a PCC Intern in Programme
Management, where she plans internal events and drafts monthly newsletters.
She also collaborates on exciting projects, contributing to an engaging
and vibrant workplace.</p>
<p>It is not just Kacy who benefitted from working in the company. FBSG sees
the value of hiring athletes and welcomed Kacy greatly into the team. <em>"Kacy's enthusiasm and creativity have greatly enriched our team. She balances her sporting commitments with professionalism and dedication,"</em> remarked
her supervisor, Leah Davison, Manager, Programs and CSR at FBSG.</p>
<p>Both Under Armour and Fujifilm Business Innovation Singapore have been
exemplary in accommodating Kacy’s sporting commitments. Both companies
have understanding colleagues who provided support and workplace flexibilities
for Kacy, allowing her to adjust work hours around her training. When Kacy
had to travel overseas for her water polo competitions, she simply informed
her supervisors in advance, and they made necessary arrangements to support
her.</p>
<p>Kacy advises fellow athletes to stay vigilant for job opportunities from <em>spex</em>Business
and not hesitate to reach out for assistance. Networking sessions organized
by <em>spex</em>Business are also valuable for exploring different roles
and experiences.</p>
<p>With a seamless and supportive process in securing internships through
the <em>spex</em>Business programme, Kacy can gain meaningful experiences
that align with her athletic commitments.</p>

<h5><strong>Nicholas Ting, Team Singapore Athlete (Water Polo) </strong></h5>
<p>With just 2.5 years under his belt, Nicholas Ting, the resilient goalkeeper
for the Singapore Men’s National Water Polo Team, has already&nbsp;made
a significant impact on&nbsp;the team.&nbsp;His journey, marked by dedication
and hard work, has seen him compete in prestigious tournaments like the
Asian Championships and World University Championships. Nicholas’s&nbsp;focus
has always been on consistent participation, personal improvement, and
contributing to the&nbsp;team’s&nbsp;success. Now a member of Team A, Nicholas
aspires to push Team Singapore to new heights on the international water
polo stage while excelling in his professional career.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Singapore Sport Institute/Athlete Life/IMG_20241009_WA0005_1_.jpg">
</div>
<p>Balancing a demanding training schedule with career aspirations is no
easy feat.&nbsp;Nicholas trains every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
with two sessions each Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp;This intense schedule
often leaves little room for recovery, let alone a full-time job.&nbsp;Finding
a company that&nbsp;not only understands these commitments but also aligns
with his career goals has been a significant challenge for Nicholas.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;Nicholas’s&nbsp;determination
and strategic approach to his career have led him to opportunities that
accommodate his athletic and professional pursuits.</p>
<p>Nicholas first learned about the <em>spex</em>Business program through
an email invitation to a networking session designed to connect national
athletes with potential employers. Curious, he attended the session alongside
a teammate, and that decision changed the course of his career. Through <em>spex</em>Business,
Nicholas has secured internships at some of&nbsp;Singapore’s leading companies,
including KPMG and DBS. The programme played an instrumental role in connecting
him with organisations that value the discipline, teamwork, and resilience
that athletes bring to the workplace.</p>
<p>During his internship at KPMG as a Digital Trust Intern, Nicholas had
the opportunity to significantly enhance his expertise in&nbsp;digital
security and compliance.&nbsp;He was actively involved in transformative
business projects and industry applications, gaining invaluable insights
into real-world challenges. One of his achievements was leading a team
of interns to victory in an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
case challenge. Under his leadership, the team crafted innovative strategies
that focused on boosting sustainability, creating jobs and improving key
performance metrics, showcasing the firm's commitment to nurturing talent
and fostering impactful solutions. At DBS, Nicholas took on the role of
a Risk Analytics Intern,&nbsp;where he developed climate scenario analyses
for regulatory reporting and spearheaded research initiatives. His ability
to juggle these demanding roles with his rigorous training schedule is
a testament to his exceptional time management and commitment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Nicholas is interning at ByteDance as a Risk Insights Analyst,
where he analyses trends in advertising content and provides data-driven
insights to optimize content strategies.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;of these roles&nbsp;has
pushed&nbsp;Nicholas’s&nbsp;abilities, setting him up for success in&nbsp;both&nbsp;his
athletic and professional endeavours.</p>
<p>Both KPMG and DBS were incredibly supportive of&nbsp;Nicholas’s&nbsp;sporting
commitments. They offered flexible work&nbsp;hours, and&nbsp;remote work&nbsp;options,&nbsp;and
even supported his participation in overseas training trips and competitions.
When Nicholas needed to be away for training or competitions, the KPMG
team would offer flexible workhours and remote working options, ensuring
seamless coverage during his absence.&nbsp;This level of understanding
and accommodation allowed Nicholas to give his hundred percent to&nbsp;both
his training and his&nbsp;work,&nbsp;without compromising on either front.</p>
<p>To fellow athletes navigating the job market, Nicholas advises being upfront
about your sporting commitments. Seek out companies that recognize the
unique skills&nbsp;you’ve&nbsp;developed through sports—discipline, teamwork,
resilience, and time management. The <em>spex</em>Business programme can
be invaluable in bridging the gap between athletic and professional careers.</p>
<p><em>“Balancing a demanding training schedule with a professional career is undeniably challenging, but&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;also what sets you apart,”&nbsp;</em>Nicholas
shares.&nbsp;<em>“These qualities are what make you stand out.&nbsp;They’re&nbsp;not obstacles;&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;your strengths. Embrace them, let them shine in your job search, and trust that the right opportunities will come to those who remain committed, both on and off the field.”</em>
</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Nicholas continues to rely on the <em>spex</em>Business
team for support as he prepares for life beyond sports. The Athlete365
Career+ Workshops and networking sessions have been particularly beneficial
in helping him navigate the transition from athlete to professional.</p>
<p>As Nicholas Ting continues to guard the net for Singapore, he also stands
as a beacon of resilience and determination for athletes striving to balance
their sporting and professional aspirations. His journey is a testament
to the power of perseverance, both in the pool and the workplace.</p>

<h5><strong>Jaslyn Hooi, Team Singapore Athlete (Badminton) Final Year Student, Ngee Ann Polytechnic (Business Studies - Entrepreneurship Management) Investment Analyst Intern, Quest Ventures</strong></h5>
<p>Poised, determined and unfazed, Jaslyn Hooi, a TeamSG badminton player
and spexScholar, stepped into her office at Ayer Rajah Crescent. As soon
as Jaslyn sits down at her desk, it is non-stop working for her until she
leaves for her training. Such was her usual routine during her internship
stint at spexBusiness partner, Quest Ventures. As an Investment Analyst
intern, she had to facilitate the investment process; be the first point
of contact with the start-ups, do an initial evaluation of the feasibility
and potential of the company to invest in. She is also in-charge of several
market access programs that help companies in gaining access to overseas
markets and amplifying their presence across the Southeast Asia region.
This is certainly no mean feat for someone with no prior working experience
at all.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>“In June 2020, the spexBusiness team was able to advise and help me secured
my internship through the network despite the COVID-19 situation then.
I am very thankful for the help that the team has given so far. They really
helped me to find the perfect internship which I really enjoy because I
don’t have to compromise on my training to reap the best out of my internship.”</p>
<p>To Jaslyn, her internship experience was like a roller-coaster ride; it
was scary yet exhilarating. Most of the time, she was challenged out of
her comfort zone, but nevertheless it had been a super rewarding journey.
It is a fast-paced on-the-job training environment where she got to learn
so much more. As Jaslyn quipped, “I want to start my own company in the
future and this internship experience gave me a good head-start in doing
so!"</p>
<p>With the moral support from her coach, management team in Singapore Badminton
Association, close friends and family members, Jaslyn was able to fulfil
her training and competition requirement, as well as complete her internship
in 30 weeks. As Jaslyn added, “They try their best to understand what I
am going through and support me when I am too torn between my sport performance
and work responsibilities. I am also thankful to Quest Ventures for providing
me with a flexible working schedule that allows me to have the luxury to
plan my working schedule around my training and physio appointments. Besides
that, my direct supervisor is very supportive of my competition schedule.
For instance, during the week of the National Open Championship 2021 (30
Jan to 7 Feb), he allowed me to take the whole week off to focus on my
competition.</p>
<p>"We are outcome-driven. So long as work is done and deadlines are met,
it does not matter how much (or how little) time one puts in.” shared James
Tan, Managing Partner at Quest Ventures. Quest Ventures recognises that
athletes are high performers and are willing to support their sporting
aspirations if they deliver their work. This is synonymous with their company
culture, which is very start-up at heart.</p>
<p>It is with such unwavering support system in place, as well as her own
perseverance and hard work that allowed Jaslyn to continue with her sporting
pursuits as a spexScholar. In summary, Jaslyn received:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Proactive advice from the team to identify suitable internship experience
that is aligned to her school’s requirements and her future career aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive support from spexBusiness partner, Quest Ventures, that
allows Jaslyn to continue her trainings and competitions during her internship
by providing:</p>

<p>Flexible work arrangements so that Jaslyn can plan her work schedule with
her training schedules</p>

<h5><strong>Chelsea Ann Sim, Team Singapore Athlete (Taekwondo) Graduate, SMU (Business Management) Intern, Deloitte (Clients and Markets Department)</strong></h5>
<p>A three-time SEA Games medallist, Team Singapore Taekwondo Exponent Chelsea
Ann Sim stands as testimony to how the spexBusiness initiative benefits
both student-athletes and athlete-employees. Having been on both ends of
the coin, she is now on her second internship placement via the initiative,
her first having been with the Corporate Business division in OSIM International.
Currently, Chelsea is interning with the Clients and Markets Department
in Deloitte, in view towards full-time conversion.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="TaeKwonDo_David_Chew_" src="/images/Our%20Work/Singapore%20Sports%20Institute/Athlete%20Life/SpexBusiness/SpexBusiness%20Athlete%20Stories/TaeKwonDo_David_Chew_.jpeg">
</div>
<p>Fully cognisant of the greater flexibility experienced by student-athletes,
Chelsea was slightly apprehensive about transitioning to an athlete-employee
fearing that the hours and rigour of a regular office job would cut into
her training time and competition opportunities.</p>
<p>Deloitte showed Chelsea that these worries were unfounded through the
provision of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understanding partners that provided Chelsea the support she needed to
balance work and her sport</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible working hours that allowed her to head to training straight after
work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A competition-friendly leave scheme that catered different tiers of leave
according to the level of the competition, including fully-paid special
leave for major competitions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Chelsea had previously expressed fears of entering the workforce with
the lack of work experience putting her at a disadvantage at hiring. However,
both internships have since assured Chelsea of a pathway of continuity
and transition post-sports. Without the stress and anxiety of having to
search for a job that would accommodate her hectic schedule, Chelsea was
thus able to turn her complete focus to her sport, proudly flying the Singapore
flag and mounting the podium across two consecutive SEA Games claiming
a Gold and a Bronze to her name.</p>
<p><em>“I got my internships through spexBusiness. I’m very appreciative of such an initiative, as it has supported me both in my sporting endeavours and career development. It has shown me that there are ways for athletes to plan a life after sport, and we have a future beyond our sporting careers. I’m very grateful to both spexBusiness and Deloitte for providing me with the opportunity to pursue excellence in my sport, and at the same time, pave the road for my future career.” </em>Chelsea

</p>
<p><em>“At Deloitte, we strongly believe in the strength of employee diversity and aim to deliver a unique Deloitte experience to all our employees.
