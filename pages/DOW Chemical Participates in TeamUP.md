On 17 and 24 March '17, staff from DOW Chemical participated in ActiveSG's TeamUP programme to develop more effective teams through sport.

'TeamUP' draws on established team development models such as Patrick Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Bruce Tuckman's Stages of team Development and uses the Game For Life (GFL) framework. GFL achieved its recognition as one of the Most Innovative Project Award at the Public Service 21 ExCEL Awards 2014. This programme has since been integrated under the initiative of Team@Work, supported by National Integration Council, that uses sports to encourage the inclusion of employees from diverse cultures and nationalities at the workplace.

Conducted at Toa Payoh Sports Hall, the team which consists of staff from different departments within the multinational company (MNC) participated in 2 half days of sporting activities where they participated in Goalball and Captain’s Ball respectively. In conjunction with facilitated conversations interwoven into the sport activities, the sessions aim to help the staff connect their learnings from sport back to work.
