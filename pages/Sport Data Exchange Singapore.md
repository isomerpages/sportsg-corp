**Sport Data Exchange Singapore (SportDexSG)**, is a digital platform that facilitates the sharing of data and insights between sport-ecosystem players in Singapore and beyond.

It is Singapore’s first data exchange that is designed specifically for the sport sector. As the sport sector emerges from the challenges of COVID-19 crisis and navigates the uncertainties in our macro and immediate operating environment, insights and data become more important to help us sense make and sharpen our ability to make policy and business decisions. 

SportDexSG will also enable ecosystem partners to collaborate and innovate as they share and apply their data to achieve mutually beneficial goals and build an open innovation culture for the sector together.
