For a programme to be recognized as a sport activity endorsed under SEP, the programme should reflect activities that not only includes a physical exertion and the development of a skill, but is also governed by a set of rules that are recognized internationally. The programme submitted must align with MOE's objectives, whose primary emphasis is to provide students with **sports opportunities in a safe environment**.

**1. DEFENSE AND MARTIAL ARTS PROGRAMMES UNDER SEP**

Sports programmes incorporating physical contact striking or sparring between participants will not be endorsed. Judo, wrestling and similar programmes may include only safe grappling. Any form of striking and choking are strictly not allowed. This must be clearly indicated in the programme submission and will be further evaluated by the panel.

**2. CHEERLEADING PROGRAMMES UNDER SEP** 

Cheerleading programmes should not incorporate the following activities and must be clearly indicated in the programme submission:

* No cheerleading formations that are more than 2-tier. For execution of 2 tier formations, trained adult spotters will be present.
* No stunts without trained adult spotter.
* No stunts above shoulder level.
* No tumbling with flight, with or without hand support. (Exception: Roundoff)
* No tossing.

**3. SWIMMING PROGRAMMES UNDER SEP** 

All Sports Providers offering swimming programmes will require their instructors/coaches to be **SwimSafer** **Certified** in addition to meeting the requirements of having the minimum NCAP Theory Level 1 (or its equivalent), NCAP Technical Level 1 (or its equivalent) and a valid recognized first aid certification.

**Instructor to Student Ratio at 1:10** Instructor to student ratio for all swimming programmes must be kept at 1:10, with the exception of programmes offered to Special Education schools, which will be at a lower ratio.  
  
**SwimSafer Instructor Course**   
Please note that it is a requirement for all swimming instructors to be registered with NROC before they can enroll in the SwimSafer Instructor Course. Places for this course will be allotted on a first-come-first-served basis.

**4. LIFESAVING PROGRAMMES UNDER SEP**

Lifesaving programmes must not be conducted at open waters and this must be clearly indicated in the programme submission.

**5. RISK ASSESSMENT**

A Risk Assessment Management Plan (RAMS) will be required to be submitted as part of the SEP programme submission.

**All vendors conducting OAL activities must comply to the criteria on the respective compliance checklists.**

A compliance checklist has been developed to ensure service providers meet the management and operation standards for the water-based and height-based OAL activities. All criteria must be met before services may be procured by schools. Compliance with the checklist must be clearly indicated in the programme submission.

Please refer to the appended [file](/files/Sport%20Education/Sport%20Education%20Programmes/Compliance%20Checklists%20for%20Procurement%20of%20OAL%20Activities_version%204%20Feb%2022.pdf) for the compliance checklists which service providers must submit to schools.
