**Coach Development Grant (CDG) Scheme Details**

<hr>

#### **Section 1: Introduction**

The Coach Development Grant (CDG) provides financial assistance to individual sports coaches who wish to upgrade their coaching knowledge and skills via attending coaching attachments, conferences, short-term courses, workshops and seminars as well as obtaining a Degree or Diploma, both locally and overseas.

All learning activities covered by this grant will be known as ‘CDG Activity’ in subsequent sections.

SportSG will review the application and deliberate on the actual grant amount for each application. **Please note that SportSG reserves the final right on the funding decision.**

Through CDG, SportSG aims to build ongoing partnerships with individual CDG recipients. Through this partnership, CDG recipients will have the opportunity to:

a. Help develop other sports coaches professionally
<br>
b. Be invited to share their sports coaching stories, knowledge, experience, and insights at CoachSG’s selected platforms (e.g., CoachSG Conference)

#### **Section 2: CDG Overview**
CoachSG aims to support as many coaches as possible in their professional development journey through CDG. Hence, we encourage each applicant to submit a maximum of 2 applications per Financial Year (FY). If an applicant submits a 3rd application within the same FY, CoachSG will prioritise funding allocation for applicants with 2 or less applications within the same FY.

**Additional Assessment Criteria for Large CDG Investments
(Original Calculated CDG Approval Amount ≥ S$5,000)**

This section only applies to applications with original calculated CDG approval amount equal or greater than (≥) S$5,000.

An original calculated CDG approval amount ≥ S$5,000 represents a significant investment from CoachSG. Hence, the applicant has to demonstrate, with appropriate supporting evidence (e.g. e-mails, letters, Certificates of Appreciation, photos, press articles), that he / she has been regularly contributing to all of the following categories within the past 3 years, in order to justify why he / she should receive the full amount entitled for his / her NROC Coach / Coach Developer level:

1. Coaching / mentoring coaches and / or athletes
2. Coach development (through (a) courses and (b) workshops)
3. General contribution to sports (e.g., competition management, technical officiating, volunteering)

Weightage for each category is shown below. Applicants who do not meet a particular criterion will be awarded 0% for that criterion.

| Category | Criteria | Weightage |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Coaching     | Regularly conducts coaching-related courses to develop coaches / athletes in the past 3 years<br>(Minimum 1 course per year) | 25%   |
| Coach Development     | Regularly mentor coaches and / or coach athletes in the past 3 years (minimum once a week) | 25%   |
|   | Regularly conducts CCE workshops for other coaches in the past 3 years (minimum 1 workshop per year) | 25%  |
| General Contribution  | General contribution to sports in past 3 years (e.g., competition management, technical officiating, volunteering) (minimum 1 role per year) | 25%  |
||Total| 100%|


Hypothetical examples are given below to illustrate how final CDG approved amount is derived based on above assessment criteria:

| Applicant #1: NROC Master Coach, Singaporean | Applicant #2: NROC Senior Coach, PR | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| *   Applied CDG for local coaching seminar<br>estimated cost = S$8,000<br>*   Based on existing guidelines (up to 75% for Singaporeans), award amount = S$5,000 (maximum cap for NROC Master Coach)<br>*   As award amount = S$5,000, After applying above criteria, applicant meets 3 out of 4 criteria (75%)<br>*   Hence, final approved amount = S$5,000 x 75% = S$3,750     | *   Applied CDG for overseas coaching course with coaching attachment<br>*   Total estimated cost = S$50,000<br>*   Based on existing guidelines (up to 75% for PRs), award amount = S$20,000 (maximum cap for NROC Senior Coach)<br>*   As award amount = S$20,000 > S$5,000, After applying above criteria, and applicant meets 2 out of 4 criteria (50%)<br>*   Hence, final approved amount = S$20,000 x 50% = S$10,000     | 


#### **Section 3: CDG Post-Activity Deliverables**

After the CDG Activity, the CDG recipient is required to complete all of the following:

**Within 1 month post-activity:**

1. Reimburse SportSG the difference between disbursed amount and actual amount utilised. For Degree / Diploma courses, applicant who fails to complete the course of study successfully is required to return 100% of the disbursed grant to SportSG. **Future applications from the same applicant will not be considered if the applicant fails to refund the required amount to SportSG**
2. Submit documentary proof of the CDG Activity:

(a) Copies of official receipts for course / registration fee, accommodation, airfare, land transfer, airport tax, travel insurance and / or certificate awarded e.g., Certificate of Attendance / Competence (where applicable)
<br>
(b) At least 3 photographs from the CDG Activity

3. Submit a written CDG Post-Activity Report (template to be provided by CoachSG)

**Within 6 months post-activity:**

* Complete an interview (in-person, virtual or written) by CoachSG for CDG publicity (for approved CDG amount > S$3k only)
* Fulfil a minimum number of points corresponding to the amount of funding received (see below for more information)

The introduction of points system is to:

a. Motivate CDG recipients to give back to local coaching community through activities of their choice
<br>
b. Educate CDG recipients that the amount of responsibility to give back and the post-CDG learning activities scale with the amount of financial support provided

**CDG recipients who fail to complete all their post-CDG Activity deliverables will have all their subsequent applications automatically rejected until they have cleared all outstanding deliverables.**

CDG recipients can choose which coach development activities they want to fulfil from the following list (subjected to CoachSG’s approval), as long as the total points of selected activities meet the minimum requirement. In general, points are classified as follow:

* Writing – 5 points per piece of work
* Deliver workshops, produce more complex resources (e.g., videos, deck) – 10 points per piece of work
* Conference presentations and lead Community of Practice (CoP) sessions – 15 points per piece of work
* Longer-term projects (e.g., consultancy, research, mentor another coach) – 20 points per piece of work

When more than 1 CDG recipient collaborate on the same deliverable, each CDG recipient will have to produce part of the deliverable (i.e., if 2 coaches attended the same funded activity and delivers a workshop together, each coach should preferably lead 1 part of the workshop).


| Approval Amount, X | Mandatory | Points to fulfil within 6 months post-activity |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| X ≤ S$1k     | Report     | 10     |
| S$1k < X ≤ S$3k  | Report     | 30     |
| S$3k < X ≤ S$5k     | Report + interview by CoachSG for CDG publicity | 45 |
| X > S$5k     | Report + interview by CoachSG for CDG publicity     | 60 |
