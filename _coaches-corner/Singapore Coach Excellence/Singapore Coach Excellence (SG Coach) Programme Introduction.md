The Singapore Coach Excellence (SG-Coach) Programme is an enhanced training and development pathway for all coaches in the community, clubs or high performance sport programmes. The aim is to establish a training and development system to develop high quality and professional coaches. Coaches trained in this programme will gain multi-dimensional skills in the area of sports science, coaching, life skills, evidence-based practices and will be able to promote social values and principles. The SG-Coach Programme replaces the National Coaching Accreditation Programme (NCAP) since 27 March 2015. As all existing NCAP certificates remain valid, obtaining accreditation from NCAP to SG-Coach is NOT required. Coaches will now be able to enrol in required certification courses based on course availability and their interests rather than a prescribed, sequential order. 

The programme consists of 3 progressive phases targeted at various development levels (Community SG-Coach, Foundation SG-Coach Development and Master / Specialist SG-Coach) with 3 main components. These 3 components are:

*   **Sports Science** \- covers various disciplines of sports science such as psychology, nutrition, biomechanics, physiology and strength and conditioning.
*   **Theory** – covers the general principles of coaching such as sport pedagogy, fundamental movement skills, sport safety and management, effective communication, Singapore sports eco-system as well as teaching of values and principles 
* **Technical** – covers sport-specific considerations such as sport demands, specific training methodologies, techniques, and sport strategies.

**My 1st Coach Programme** is designed for adults especially parents, equipping them with knowledge and skills to develop FUNdamental movement skills in their children so that they may lead a physically active lifestyle.

**Community SG-Coach** is designed for individuals who wish to be an Assistant Coach mainly in Learn-to-Play Programmes (LTPP).

**SG-Coach Level One** is designed for individuals who wish to coach novice participants in community and / or youth sport.

**SG-Coach Level Two** is designed for coaching competitive athletes in their early years of competition. Specialised topics in these courses include the development of annual periodisation plans, training methodologies, test and measurement, sports science applications, social values and principles, and sport analyses.

**SG-Coach Level Three**. The individual would need to possess knowledge in sports science to apply evidence-based coaching. They would be trained in multi-year periodisation planning, advanced sport analyses and training methodologies, performance tracking and analyses, international competition systems, and sports science applications. A significant portion of the module will be taught through workshops, facilitation and mentorships with a National Coach. At this level, coaches may also opt to specialise in 1 or more of these 3 areas: (1) community sport; (2) performance sport and / or (3) para sport.
