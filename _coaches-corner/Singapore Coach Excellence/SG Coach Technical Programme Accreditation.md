SG-Coach Technical Programme covers sport-specific considerations (such as sport demands, specific training methodologies, techniques, and sport strategies) while SG-Coach Integrated Programme incorporates both Theory component and sport-specific considerations. Hence, possession of an Integrated certificate would be viewed as possession of both Theory and Technical certifications. Both Technical and Integrated Programme are delivered via a mixture of classroom-based and workshop-based teaching with assessments that may come in the form of assignment, demonstration, and / or examination.

There are two methods of accreditation available for interested individuals:

*   Accreditation through Coursework: This is suitable for individuals who wish to gain knowledge and / or competencies through attending classes, workshops and assessment. Please contact the respectively National Sports Association (NSA) (refer to list below) for course information.
    
*   Accreditation through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL): This is suitable for individuals who had formal learning in areas of coaching. All Technical / Integrated accreditation via RPL are subjected to the evaluation and approval of the relevant NSA. Please contact the respective NSA (refer to list below) for more information:
