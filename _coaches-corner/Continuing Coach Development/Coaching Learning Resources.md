#### **Foreword**

Dear Coaches,

The COVID-19 situation has been a challenging time for all of us as face-to-face trainings and sports events are cancelled. Home-based learning (HBL) has become a new norm as schools are engaging their students through online lessons and many industries are also engaging their clients through online video-conferencing. As such, more than ever as coaches we need to adapt to the changing situations and equip ourselves with the necessary skills and resources to conduct coaching online. We believe that when this season is over, the upskilling that we commit ourselves to during this time will enable us to be more adept at adopting multi-pronged approaches in engaging our athletes through both offline and online means. We have prepared some resources that we hope will get your started on / enhance your online coaching practice and experience:

#### **Getting Started to Coach Online**

**1. Guides for Online Coaching Practice**

**A. Quick-Starter Guide on Using Video-Conferencing Tools for E-Coaching**

In view of the current COVID-19 situation, CoachSG has compiled a quick starter guide on available video-conferencing platforms that you can use to  conduct your coaching online. Included in this guide are quick starter videos, features of the respective platforms and also price plans. Most of the mentioned platforms provide free features that are sufficient to kickstart online coaching sessions:

**B. Coaches Digital Curriculum Design Capabilities**

Bringing our coaching online may seem foreign to most but it has many similar principles as coaching physically. This guide will enable you to prepare your online coaching sessions through step-by-step guidance and provides questions that you can ask yourself to ensure an enjoyable and effective coaching experience both for you and your athletes:
