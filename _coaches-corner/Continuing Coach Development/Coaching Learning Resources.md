<h4><strong>Foreword</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Coaches,</p>
<p>The COVID-19 situation has been a challenging time for all of us as face-to-face
trainings and sports events are cancelled. Home-based learning (HBL) has
become a new norm as schools are engaging their students through online
lessons and many industries are also engaging their clients through online
video-conferencing. As such, more than ever as coaches we need to adapt
to the changing situations and equip ourselves with the necessary skills
and resources to conduct coaching online. We believe that when this season
is over, the upskilling that we commit ourselves to during this time will
enable us to be more adept at adopting multi-pronged approaches in engaging
our athletes through both offline and online means. We have prepared some
resources that we hope will get your started on / enhance your online coaching
practice and experience:</p>
<h4><strong>Getting Started to Coach Online</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>1. Guides for Online Coaching Practice</strong></h5>
<p><strong>A. Quick-Starter Guide on Using Video-Conferencing Tools for E-Coaching</strong>
</p>
<p>In view of the current COVID-19 situation, CoachSG has compiled a quick
starter guide on available video-conferencing platforms that you can use
to&nbsp; conduct your coaching online. Included in this guide are quick
starter videos, features of the respective platforms and also price plans.
Most of the mentioned platforms provide free features that are sufficient
to kickstart online coaching sessions: <a href="/files/Support/Coaches'%20Corner/Continuing%20Coach%20Development/Coaching%20Learning%20Resources/Quick_Starter_Online_Video_Conferencing_Resource_for_Your_Coaching.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Quick Starter Online Video Conferencing Resource for Your Coaching</a>

<p><strong>B. Coaches Digital Curriculum Design Capabilities</strong>
</p>
<p>Bringing our coaching online may seem foreign to most but it has many
similar principles as coaching physically. This guide will enable you to
prepare your online coaching sessions through step-by-step guidance and
provides questions that you can ask yourself to ensure an enjoyable and
effective coaching experience both for you and your athletes:</p>
