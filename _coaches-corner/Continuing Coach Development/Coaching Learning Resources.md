Dear Coaches,

The COVID-19 situation has been a challenging time for all of us as face-to-face trainings and sports events are cancelled. Home-based learning (HBL) has become a new norm as schools are engaging their students through online lessons and many industries are also engaging their clients through online video-conferencing. As such, more than ever as coaches we need to adapt to the changing situations and equip ourselves with the necessary skills and resources to conduct coaching online. We believe that when this season is over, the upskilling that we commit ourselves to during this time will enable us to be more adept at adopting multi-pronged approaches in engaging our athletes through both offline and online means. We have prepared some resources that we hope will get your started on / enhance your online coaching practice and experience:
