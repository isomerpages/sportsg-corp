The Continuing Coach Education (CCE) programme gives coaches the platform to continually upgrade themselves in their area of coaching. Sport Singapore believes that coaches are able to deliver higher standards of coaching as they become more proficient and knowledgeable.

For a list of CCE programmes conducted or publicized by the Coaching Development department, please refer to the Course Calendar.

**Sport Singapore’s Role in CCE**

Sport Singapore is responsible for: 

* Identifying and/or organising useful upgrading activities (e.g. courses, conferences, seminars, clinics, etc.) for coaches
* Working with the respective National Sports Associations (NSAs) and other relevant bodies to provide a comprehensive CCE programme for coaches
    
Sport Singapore reserves the right to validate the credibility of the CCE activities, either with the respective NSAs or any other respective organisations and appointed agencies.
