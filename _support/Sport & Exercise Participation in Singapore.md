<p><strong>Measuring Sport &amp; Exercise Participation in Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>The National Sport &amp; Exercise Participation Survey NSPSis Singapore’s
only annual national survey on sport and exercise participation among citizens
and permanent residents aged 13 years old and above. Data is captured via
face-to-face interviews among randomly selected households from the Department
of Statistics. Started in 1987, NSPS was conducted every five years, and
in between the years, a smaller scale study “Sport Index” was deployed
to capture annual data for trending analyses. Insights from the survey
is used to shape the policies and strategies for sport programmes, initiatives,
infrastructures, and campaigns for residents to stay active and well.</p>
<p>In 2015, NSPS was converted to an annual survey with monthly interviews
accumulating to a sample size of at least 4,500 per year. This shift enabled
more robust representation of sport and exercise behaviours and trends
across the year, together with insights on participation profiles, motivations
and barriers to participation, and the health and social benefit they experienced
from being active.</p>
