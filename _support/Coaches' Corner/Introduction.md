<p>Coaching in Singapore is an immensely important part of Sport Singapore’s
responsibility to its community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoachSG recognises the importance of coaching as a career to achieve the
sporting potential of athletes and participants. Coaches give their time
and expertise to nurture our rising stars. In so doing, they add to our
community as well as our national profile.</p>
<p>Sport Singapore offers different coach development programmes:</p>
