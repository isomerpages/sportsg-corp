<p>The Government of Singapore was a signatory to the Copenhagen Declaration
on Anti-Doping in Sport in 2003 and had also adopted the UNESCO International
Convention Against Doping in Sport in 2005 by accession, thereby formally
recognising Singapore’s commitment to implement the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/resources/world-anti-doping-program/world-anti-doping-code" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">World Anti-Doping Code</a>&nbsp;(“WAD
Code”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) was established in 2010 by the then Ministry
of Community Development, Youth and Sports as the national anti-doping
authority for Singapore and is responsible for the implementation and management
of the Anti-Doping Programme for sport in Singapore.</p>

<br>(a) Plan, coordinate and implement an effective doping control programme;
<br>(b) Advocate doping-free sport in Singapore through education programmes;

Anti-Doping Policy of Singapore, the ADS Anti-Doping Rules, and the WADA
Code;
<br>(d) Pursue all potential anti-doping rule violations within its jurisdiction;
<br>(e) Encourage reciprocal testing between national anti-doping organisations;
and
<br>(f) Promote anti-doping research.</p>
