<p>The National Registry of Coaches (NROC) was launched in 2003 to raise
the standard and professionalism of sports coaching in Singapore. It aims
to ensure that coaches meet baseline qualifications, that coaches continue
to practise and improve, and that coaches provide a safe environment for
their athletes. Today, there are over 6,100 coaches listed across 89 sports
in the NROC and coaches can choose to publish their profile via an online
public database called "Find a Coach".</p>
<p>Coaches in the NROC are duly certified under the Singapore Coach Excellence
(SG-Coach) Programme (formerly known as the National Coaching Accreditation
Programme or NCAP) in their respective sports and must hold Standard First
Aid certification (including CPR&amp;AED). They are committed to abide
by the Coach’s Code of Ethics and meet the requirements for the Continuing
Coach Education Programme. This is part of the quality assurance to users
of the coaching services that the coaches registered under NROC are up-to-date
in their coaching knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Through NROC, Sport Singapore aims to give recognition to coaches who
have been certified and deemed competent by a national body. Doing so also
allows the public to have easy access to qualified coaches.</p>
