<p>Coaches may encounter incidences of emergency or injury during the course
of coaching. Thus&nbsp;it is essential that coaches are trained in the
knowledge and skills in&nbsp;<strong>Standard First Aid, Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and usage of Automated External Defibrillator (AED)</strong>.
This will better prepare coaches for emergency situations and manage the
risks involved in sports coaching.</p>
<p>Sport Singapore requires all NROC-registered coaches to have a valid Standard
First Aid certificate.&nbsp;<strong>The &nbsp;Standard First Aid course should include both theoretical examination and practical assessment including AED, CPR and bandaging of wounds, as stipulated by Singapore Resuscitation and First Aid Council (SRFAC).</strong>
</p>
<p>The SRFAC accredits&nbsp;Standard First Aid (SFA) Courses by various training
centres. The objective of this process is to ensure they have met the requirements
for training facilities and training standards.&nbsp;We regret that we
will not be able to accredit other first aid courses in view of the different
course content and contextualization.</p>
<p>Please&nbsp;refer to the&nbsp;SRFAC's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://srfac.sg/directory/training-centre/?qs=&amp;certificate%5B%5D=846" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://srfac.sg/directory/training-centre/</a>&nbsp;for
the latest list of valid and accredited SFA training centres. You may refer
to the image below for reference.</p>
<p>Please note to check the "License Expiry" of each training centre (see
image below).</p>

<p><strong>Please note that Standard First Aid (SFA), CPR and AED courses (including refresher courses) will NOT be awarded Continuing Coach Education (CCE)&nbsp;hours as these are considered standard requirement for coaches.</strong>
