SportSync launched in 2018 which includes features such as NROC membership e-card accessibility and updating of Continuing Coach Education records via e-Logbook. 

CoachSG has since discontinued all physical copies of the membership card and logbook with effect from 1 April 2020. Please do logon to [www.sportsync.sg](www.sportsync.sg) for more information. Below are some guides to aid in accessing SportSync's function.
