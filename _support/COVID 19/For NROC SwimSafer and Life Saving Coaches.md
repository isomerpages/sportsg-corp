<h4><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>National Registry of Coaches</strong></h5>
<p><strong>1. Who will be eligible for this extension ?</strong>
</p>
<p>All current members - both Provisional and Full (Coach, Senior Coach and
Master Coach) membership, as of&nbsp;<strong>8 June&nbsp;2021</strong>&nbsp;with
a valid (active/inactive) membership&nbsp;will receive an extension of&nbsp;<strong>1 year</strong>&nbsp;to
your membership. Other membership status such as expired, suspended would
not be eligible. For example. if your membership expires 30 Jun 2020, the
new expiry date would be 30 Jun 2021. No action is required on your end.
It would take some time to update the membership details in our system
and you shall be notified by email once this is done. For those of you
who have submitted renewal applications but have not received the official
approval, we shall advise you individually if there is any follow-up required.</p>
<p><strong>2. Will I receive a new membership card with the extended new date?</strong>
</p>
<p>For the membership card, please note that the change would be effected
on the&nbsp;<a href="/files/Support/Coaches'%20Corner/Covid%2019/SwimSafer%20%20%20Life%20Saving/How_to_access_e-card_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">e-card</a>&nbsp;ONLY.
We would not be issuing physical cards for this extension and to new members.
Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="/files/Support/Coaches'%20Corner/Covid%2019/SwimSafer%20%20%20Life%20Saving/How_to_access_e-card_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">guide</a> on
how to access your NROC membership e-card.</p>
<p>Since SportSync’s launch in 2018, it includes features such as e-card
and updating of Continuing Coach Education records via e-logbook. As many
of our coaches are already onboarded to this new platform, CoachSG will
discontinue all physical copies of the card and logbook with effect from
1 April 2020. Please do access&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sportsync.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.sportsync.sg</a>&nbsp;for your e-card
and e-logbook. Please refer to&nbsp;<a href="/files/Support/Coaches'%20Corner/Covid%2019/SwimSafer%20%20%20Life%20Saving/How_to_access_e-Logbook_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">guide</a>&nbsp;on
how to access your e-logbook.</p>
<p><strong>3. My Standard First Aid certification has expired / due to expire soon, what should I do?</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore Resuscitation First Aid Council (SRFAC) have announced resumption
of training for learners while abiding by the nation-wide general guidelines
by for workplaces by Ministry of Manpower. For the latest update, please
visit&nbsp;<a href="https://srfac.sg/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.srfac.sg/news/</a>
</p>
<p>In view of safety considerations, coaches who did not renew their Standard
First Aid within the acceptable time period are not allowed to renew their
membership with the NROC.&nbsp;For enquiries on first aid training, you
may also contact SRFAC directly at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.srfac.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.srfac.sg</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Are there any changes to the Continuing Coaching Education (CCE) requirements for renewal?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Continuing Coach Education requirements for renewal of membership
would&nbsp;remain unchanged for now. We are working on designing and developing
the necessary online (Internet-based) infrastructure and programmes that
you may utilise to deliver your coaching practice virtually. You may now
also use coaching education hours in place of coaching practice (up to
50% of the required hours). E.g., if you only manage to perform coaching
practice for&nbsp;10 hours&nbsp;as a Coach and foresee you have difficulty
completing another&nbsp;5 hours, you may seek relevant online learning
to use as coaching education to fulfil the remaining 5 hours. Please ensure
that you can obtain endorsement for completion of the online learning,
or please pen down a Reflection (download example templates&nbsp;<a href="/files/Support/Coaches'%20Corner/Covid%2019/SwimSafer%20%20%20Life%20Saving/Reflection_Template1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="/files/Support/Coaches'%20Corner/Covid%2019/SwimSafer%20%20%20Life%20Saving/Reflection_Template2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>) to record your learning. You can also refer to the list of resources
at Q8 for other options on learning and development.</p>
<p>Please obtain email endorsements from your CCE training coordinators or
providers (for coaching education hours) and employers (for coaching practice
hours) and attach them online as evidence of completion.</p>
