<h3><strong>What is NROC?</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>National Registry of Coaches (NROC)</strong> was launched in
2003 to raise the standard and professionalism of sports coaching in Singapore.
It aims to ensure that coaches meet baseline qualifications, that coaches
continue to practise and improve, and that coaches provide a safe environment
for their athletes. Today, there are over 6,000 coaches listed across 74
sports in the NROC and coaches can choose to publish their profile via
an online public database called "<a href="https://coachsg.sportsingapore.gov.sg/nroc/find-a-coach" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Find a Coach</a>".</p>
<p>Coaches in the NROC are duly certified under the <a href="/support-resources/coaches-corner/singapore-coach-excellence-sg-coach-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Coach Excellence (SG-Coach) Programme</a> (formerly
known as the National Coaching Accreditation Programme or NCAP) in their
respective sports and must hold Standard First Aid certification (including
CPR &amp; AED). They are committed to abide by the&nbsp;<a href="/support-resources/coaches-corner/coachs-code-of-ethics/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Coach’s Code of Ethics</a>&nbsp;and
meet the requirements for the <a href="/support-resources/coaches-corner/continuing-coach-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Continuing Coach Education</a> Programme.
This is part of the quality assurance to users of the coaching services
that the coaches registered under NROC are up-to-date in their coaching
knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Through NROC, Sport Singapore aims to give recognition to coaches who
have been certified and deemed competent by a national body. Doing so also
allows the public to have easy access to <a href="https://coachsg.sportsingapore.gov.sg/nroc/find-a-coach" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">qualified coaches</a>.</p>

<p>Sport Singapore introduced the provisional membership category in January
2017. The provisional membership allows existing and aspiring sport coaches
to participate in academic, educational and professional development activities
to improve their coaching practice as they work toward completing all requirements
of full NROC membership.</p>
<p>Over a three-year provisional membership period, they could be given priority
enrolment into various coaching courses and activities organised by Sport
Singapore, their respective&nbsp;National Sports Association&nbsp;and other
organisations. The aim is to prepare them to obtain the necessary certification
to become a full member within the NROC and to stay current in the practice
of sport coaching as a profession.</p>
