Singapore Sport Institute (SSI) recognises that embracing innovation is a critical component to stay ahead of the curve in the face of an ever-changing sport eco-system.Â  Being innovation-integrated is one of the fundamental principles of SSI even as we continue to seek new ideas and game-changers for sport.

The outcome of the innovation process is a sustained growth for sport, the sport eco-system and having a positive effect on the national sport delivery system.
