#### **THERAPEUTIC USE EXEMPTION (TUE)**

A Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) is necessary before an athlete uses a prescribed prohibited substance or method for the treatment of a legitimate medical condition.

Athletes should advise all medical personnel of their obligation to abide by the anti-doping rules of their sport and that any medical treatment received must not violate these rules.
