**What is RSS?**

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a feed format that gives you the latest news even when you are not on [www.antidoping.org.sg](http://www.antidoping.org.sg/).

You can choose to receive news headlines from different categories and they will be delivered to your desktop news reader whenever there's an update. This service is free and for personal, non-commercial use.

   
**How do I access RSS ?**

1. Install a news reader

To use RSS, you will need a news reader that will download and display the RSS content.  
  
There are many different versions available, many for free. Some are downloadable applications, others are accessed using a web browser. The news reader also allows you to view data feeds from other news sources on the same page.

You can download a reader [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator).
