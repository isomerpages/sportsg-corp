The laboratory that has analysed your A Sample will report the results simultaneously to the Anti-Doping Organisation, such as Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS), and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Your B Sample is frozen and analysed if there is an Adverse Analytical Finding on your A Sample. Note that the samples analysed are identified by code numbers and not athlete names.

Three possible outcomes may arise from sample analysis - a Negative Analytical Finding, an Atypical Finding or an Adverse Analytical Finding.
 
**NEGATIVE ANALYTICAL FINDING**

A negative test result will be issued by the laboratory if no prohibited substance or evidence of the use of a prohibited method is detected in the sample.

**ATYPICAL FINDING**

The body naturally produces some prohibited substances, such as testosterone. The presence of such substances outside what is considered to be a normal range in the A Sample may result in the laboratory reporting an Atypical Finding.
For such cases, ADS will determine if:
•	a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) has been granted
•	there has been a departure from the International Standard for Testing or International Standard for Laboratories that may have caused the atypical finding.
Further investigation will follow if the review reveals that it was not a TUE or departure from procedures that caused the atypical finding.
The athlete will only be notified when ADS has completed its investigations and decided whether it will bring the atypical finding forward as an adverse analytical finding.  No further action will be taken if there is no evidence of use of a prohibited substance. ADS will report the atypical finding as an adverse analytical finding, if there is evidence of use.

ADVERSE ANALYTICAL FINDING
If the laboratory reports an adverse analytical finding in the A Sample, ADS will determine whether:
* a TUE has been granted
* there has been a departure from the International Standard for Testing or International Standard for Laboratories that may have caused the adverse analytical finding.
ADS will report the outcome of the review to the Athlete if the review reveals that it was not a TUE or departure from procedures that caused the adverse analytical finding.

ANTI-DOPING RULE VIOLATIONS
The detection of a prohibited substance in a sample is only one of many ways that can result in an anti-doping rule violation. Doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following anti-doping rule violations that can result in a sanction.

An athlete may be deemed to have committed an anti-doping rule violation if they:
1.	Have a prohibited substance or its metabolites in their urine or blood sample;
2.	Use, or attempt to use, a prohibited substance and/or prohibited method;
3.	Evade, refuse or fail to submit to sample collection after notification of testing without compelling reason;
4.	Fail to provide accurate athlete whereabouts information resulting in any combination of 3 missed tests and/or filing failures within a 12-month period;
5.	Tamper, or attempt to tamper, with any part of the doping control process;
6.	Possess a prohibited substance and/or prohibited method;
7.	Traffick, or attempt to traffick, a prohibited substance and/or prohibited method;
8.	Administer, or attempt to administer, a prohibited substance and/or prohibited method to any athlete; 
9.	Complicity: assist, encourage, aid, abet, conspire or cover up an anti-doping rule violation; and
10.	Prohibited Association: associate with a person such as a coach, doctor or physio who has been found guilty of a criminal or disciplinary offence equivalent to a doping violation
11.	Acts by an Athlete or Other Person to Discourage or Retaliate against Reporting to Authorities

While items 1 to 4 apply to athletes, items 5 to 11 applies to athletes and athlete support personnel.
An athlete support personnel, such as a Coach, Team Manager or Doctor, may also be sanctioned if they are deemed to have violated any anti-doping rule. 

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has published a global list of Athlete Support Personnel who are currently suspended from working with Athletes or other Persons. For the updated list, please refer to the
