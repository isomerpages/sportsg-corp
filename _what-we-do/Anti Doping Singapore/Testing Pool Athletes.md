#### **TESTING POOLS**

Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) has established a Registered Testing Pool (ADS RTP) and a Domestic Testing Pool (ADS DTP) to ensure the effective implementation, coordination, administration and enforcement of the ADS testing programme.

Athletes in the ADS RTP and the ADS DTP, and any other athlete, who meets ADS' definition of athlete under the ADS Anti-Doping Policy, can be subject to both in-competition and out-of-competition doping control tests.

An athlete who has been identified for inclusion in either the ADS RTP or ADS DTP will be notified by ADS directly or through their National Sports Association (NSA).Â  ADS shall in consultation with the respective NSA, identify possible athlete(s) for inclusion into the ADS RTP or ADS DTP based on the criteria listed below. However, ADS shall have the final decision and shall not discuss the reasons for including a particular athlete or athletes into either testing pool.
