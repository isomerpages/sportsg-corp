The Government of Singapore was a signatory to the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport in 2003 and had also adopted the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport in 2005 by accession, thereby formally recognizing Singapore's commitment to implement the World [World Anti-Doping Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/World-Anti-Doping-Program/Sports-and-Anti-Doping-Organizations/The-Code/) ("WAD Code").

Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) was established in 2010 by the then Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports as the national anti-doping authority for Singapore and is a division within the Singapore Sports Council (rebranded as "Sport Singapore" or "SportSG" with effect from 1 April 2014) responsible for the implementation and management of the Anti-Doping Programme for sport in Singapore.
ADS' primary responsibilities are to:
(a)	Plan, coordinate and implement an effective doping control programme;
(b)	Advocate doping-free sport in Singapore through education programmes;
(c)	Monitor National Sports Associations for their compliance with the Anti-Doping Policy of Singapore, the ADS Anti-Doping Rules, and the WADA Code;
(d)	Pursue all potential anti-doping rule violations within its jurisdiction;
(e)	Encourage reciprocal testing between national anti-doping organisations; and
(f)	Promote anti-doping research.

#### **MISSION**

ADS' mission is to ensure sport in Singapore is free of doping through the implementation of effective education, detection, research and international co-operation initiatives. We work together with the sport bodies to protect the right of Athletes to participate in clean sport.

#### **VISION**
Every Singaporean athlete is a True Winner.

#### **GOVERNANCE**

The work of Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) is governed by the [Anti-Doping Policy of Singapore](/anti-doping-singapore/resources/policies-and-forms/) ("Policy") and the ADS Anti-Doping Rules ("Rules") that are established in accordance with the [WAD Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/the-code) and its [International Standards](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/international-standards).

The [World Anti-Doping Code](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/the-code) ("WAD Code") provides a framework for the harmonization of anti-doping policies, rules and regulations across all sports and countries in the world.
