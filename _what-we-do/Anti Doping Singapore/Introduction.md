The Government of Singapore was a signatory to the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport in 2003 and adopted the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport in 2005 by accession, thereby formally recognising Singapore's commitment to implement the World Anti-Doping Code ("WAD Code").

Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) serves as the national anti-doping authority for Singapore, commissioned in 2010 by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports. A division under Sport Singapore, ADS is responsible for implementing and managing the Anti-Doping Programme for sport in Singapore, ensuring sport in Singapore is free of doping through effective education, detection, research and international cooperation initiatives. 

ADS' primary responsibilities are to:
* Plan, coordinate and implement an effective doping control programme;
* Advocate doping-free sport in Singapore through education programmes;
* Monitor National Sports Associations for their compliance with the Anti-Doping Policy of Singapore, the ADS Anti-Doping Rules, and the WADA Code;
* Pursue all potential anti-doping rule violations within its jurisdiction;
* Encourage reciprocal testing between national anti-doping organisations; and
* Promote anti-doping research.
