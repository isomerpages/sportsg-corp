Check Medications & Drugs
-------------------------

This database of medications sold in Singapore is updated monthly, and mapped to the latest Prohibited List, which is revised annually. Supplement Warning ADS cannot advise the status of supplements in sport because they are not comprehensively regulated in Singapore. Supplements have occasionally been known to cause a positive test due to ingredients not being listed on the label, or impurities during manufacturing. Under the World Anti-Doping Code's strict liability rule, athletes are responsible for any substance found in their body.
