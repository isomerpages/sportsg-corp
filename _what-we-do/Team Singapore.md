**Team Singapore** is the united identity of elite athletes, coaches and officials from Singapore that represents the country in major multi-sport games and identified international competitions. It was mooted by the then-Ministry of Community Development and Sports, and launched on 20 April 2001 by then-Deputy Prime Minister Dr Tony Tan.

Team Singapore is anchored by the three core attributes of Pride, Performance and Perseverance. These attributes underscore the traits of a winning team and are the critical elements of sportsmanship and excellence that propel the nation forward to succeed on the worldâ€™s sporting stage.

Team Singapore is a shared identity for all Singaporeans, where sport is the national language. It represents the unique connection between our athletes and every other Singaporean, young or old, as they embark on a sporting journey as one. This relationship extends beyond the sporting fraternity and the major Games. Team Singapore is about living better lives as we embody values inherent in sport: a winning spirit, an appreciation for teamwork, a commitment to purpose, the importance of ethical behaviour and a love for our country.
