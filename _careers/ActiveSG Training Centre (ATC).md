ActiveSG Training Centre (ATC) is at the forefront in the transformation&nbsp;journey towards a Learning Organisation.

We are committed to harness and develop our staff to their maximum potential through innovative learning and growth pathway.

This year we achieved the Workplace Learning Organisation of Competence (Gold) Award, conferred by the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (NACE).

The award recognises our many learning initiatives to upskill and add value to our sport champions. Our three strategic pillars of Workplace Learning, Knowledge and Value Creation, and Networking and Partnership help pave the way.

To promote self-directed learning, ATC is also progressively embracing online learning through CSC Learn, SportSG-ED and access via mobile phone.
