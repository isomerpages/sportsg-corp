The 2015 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games will be back in Singapore after 22 years as part of the nation’s 50th anniversary and organisers today assured that this will be a memorable Games that Singaporeans can be part and proud of.

2\. “It is our turn to host the SEA Games after 22 years and it will be a key milestone in Singapore’s 50th Anniversary celebrations. This is a special year for all Singaporeans, and SINGSOC will strive to deliver a Games that will bring people together in a fitting and memorable celebration,” said Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chairman of the Singapore SEA Games Organising Committee Executive Committee (SINGSOC EXCO).

##### **Efforts to engage the community to ramp up from March**

3\. With the multisport event being a key part of the SG50 celebrations, organisers are making every effort to involve and excite Singaporeans in the lead up to the Games.

4\. From March onwards, the community can expect to see activities being ramped up, starting with a mass event on Orchard Road on 7 March to rally for One Team Singapore. Highlights of the event include the lighting up of the SEA Games Arch at Scotts/ Paterson Road; unfurling of the Team Singapore flag; performance of SEA Games songs; and SEA Games sports tryouts among other activities.

5\. Over the next few months, efforts to bring the Games to the heartlands and Southeast Asian neighbours will be implemented. These include the:

* Torch-Up! projects – Ideas conceptualised by the community to mark Singapore’s 50th birthday and the 28th SEA Games, realised in the form of 30 art structures and 20 event-based projects
* Digital Torch-Up game – A web-browser based game where the SEA Games mascot NILA will ‘travel’ the region to collect flames (digitally) to contribute to the fire that will light up the physical SEA Games torch
* 50-Day Countdown – Schools, corporates, interest groups, and voluntary welfare organisations will be invited to own a number (from 1-50), be part of a creative number formation, and share their stories on various platforms

6\. “Engaging everyone and getting them onboard the SEA Games journey is critical to the success of the Games. We will reach out to different segments of the community whether it is through activities organised by us or leveraging on existing community programme. We will offer opportunities for people to feel and be involved in the Games,” added Mr Lim.

##### **Sponsorship target of S$50 million surpassed with 15 new sponsors coming onboard**

7\. SINGSOC also announced today that it has surpassed its sponsorship target of S$50 million, with 15 new sponsors coming on board. The new sponsors, spread across various tiers, will bring the total sponsorship secured for the 2015 SEA Games to over S$60 million.

8\. On achieving the sponsorship target set in October 2013, Mr Lim said, “We are happy that the sponsors have stepped up to contribute generously to the Games. This speaks of the value of the Games in reaching out to Singaporeans and the region.”

##### **Accessible events, affordable ticket prices**

9\. As part of a concerted effort to make the Games accessible to all, tickets to the sports competitions have been kept affordable. Fans will enjoy free admission to 18 of the 36 sports. Tickets to the remaining sports competitions are priced from as low as $5, with concession prices made available to students, senior citizens and full-time National Servicemen. There is also a 20% discount off every purchase of four or more tickets, to encourage family and friends to catch the Games in action.

10\. “We decided that as one of the key events of SG50 celebrations, we should make the events affordable and accessible so that every Singaporean has the opportunity to experience the Games,” explained Mr Lim. “This is a not-for-profit event. At the same time, we are committed to ensuring reasonableness in our spending and managing within the projected budget. We also have our sponsors, volunteers and partners to thank for stepping up to contribute generously to the Games.”
