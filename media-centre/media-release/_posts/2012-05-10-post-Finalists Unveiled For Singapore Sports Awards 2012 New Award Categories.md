### **Finalists Unveiled For Singapore Sports Awards 2012 New Award Categories**

Singapore, 10 May 2012 - The nation's most prestigious recognition for sporting achievements, the Singapore Sports Awards (SSA), has recently included three new award categories, 'Most Inspiring Sports Story of the Year', the 'Best Sport Event of the Year (International)' and 'Best Sport Event of the Year (Local)'. Through these award categories, SSA's organisers, the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), would like to give due recognition to sporting partners that work hard behind the scenes to help shape Sporting Singapore.

2. "Through the introduction of these award categories, we want to extend the tribute to other essential partners of Sporting Singapore, the media and event organisers. And to commend them for their contributions and a job well done," said Mr Low Teo Ping, Vice President, SNOC, who is also the Chairman of SSA 2012 Organising Committee. "Through these awards, we also hope to encourage more organisers and journalists to produce quality events and stories that will inspire more Singaporeans to be involved in sports."

3. Calls for nominations for the three award categories were made in April 2012 and the finalists were selected by judging panels comprising industry professionals, Team Singapore athletes, and president of national sports associations, among others, in early May. The judges also chose one winner per award category in a secret ballot.

4. For the 'Most Inspiring Sports Story of the Year', the submissions were evaluated based on how well it had depicted themes of triumph and/or selflessness of the human spirit in a sporting context. The three stories shortlisted are:

* Dark past, bright future by Denis Edward, The New Paper
* Granny battling cancer wins gold by Terrence Voon, The Straits Times
* Not just flesh and blood, but the football HEART by Terrence Voon, The Straits Times

5. For the 'Best Sport Event (International)' and 'Best Sport Event (Local)', the entries were assessed based on key aspects such as scale of the event, how well it is organised and marketed, the originality and innovativeness of the concept, the attractiveness of the event to athletes and the greater community, including corporate sponsors and live spectators, among others. The finalists in these categories are:

| Best Sports Event (International) | Best Sports Event (Local) |
| -------- | -------- | 
| 2011 Formula 1 Singtel Singapore Grand Prix  | OCBC Cycle Singapore 2011     |

| Barclays Singapore Open 2011  | Sundown Marathon 2011    |

6. The winner for the 'Most Inspiring Sports Story of the Year', will receive $1,000 cash prize and a trophy, while winners of the 'Best Sport Event (International)' and 'Best Sport Event (Local)' will be presented with a trophy each. The winners will be made known at the Singapore Sports Awards 2012 event on 29 May 2012.
