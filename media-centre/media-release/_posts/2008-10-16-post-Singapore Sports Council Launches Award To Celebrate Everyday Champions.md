### **Singapore Sports Council Launches Award To Celebrate Everyday Champions**

POSB comes on board as title sponsor for the new "POSB Everyday Champions Award" highlighting a growing trend amongst local organisations taking up sponsorship in sports

The Jurong West Sports and Recreation Centre was the venue for a big splash today - not for a swimming meet but for the launch of a nationwide search for champions for sports. The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) together with title sponsor, POSB, launched the POSB Everyday Champions Award 2009, aimed at recognising everyday individuals and organisations that have consistently gone beyond their call of duty and responsibility, so that others can enjoy sports and grow through sports.

Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports & Ministry of Transport, Mr Teo Ser Luck, was the Guest-of-Honour at the launch. The POSB Everyday Champions Award 2009 is an amalgamation of two previous annual Awards - Coaches Recognition Award and the Sporting Singapore Inspiration Awards - making the POSB Everyday Champions Award 2009 the most prestigious sporting inspiration award in Singapore.

To launch the Award, Team Singapore swimmer, Theresa Goh and Team Singapore Waterpolo players, Alvin Lee and Yip Ren Kai, dropped off their very own nominations for the champions behind their sporting success, after treating the audience to some "live" action by diving into the pool and swimming a lap.

In addition, Mr Teo also put forward his nomination, followed by SSC's CEO Mr Oon Jin Teik and a representative from DBS Group.

Describing the Award as a "pivotal recognition for everyday Singaporeans and organisations who had contributed to the country's sporting culture", Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO of SSC added, "A POSB Everyday Champion can be your friend and colleague, your teacher, coach or neighbour who has a passion for sports, and translates that passion into inspiring others to play sports and grow through sports. It is very much in line with the Let's Play spirit of active participation in sports and will encourage more Singaporeans to embrace a sporting culture."

As the People's Bank, POSB is well-positioned to be the title sponsor of the Award. Mr Richard Stanley, CEO of DBS Group Holdings & DBS Bank, said, "POSB is known as the People's Bank, and I see POSB as a great fit for an award that celebrates the contributions of everyday Singaporeans. The POSB Everyday Champions Award is an award that recognises the unsung heroes among us, who, guided by their passion and commitment, devoted their energies to support, insire and spur us on to adopt a sporting lifestyle. POSB is excited to have this opportunity to celebrate these everyday heroes behind the hero."

The POSB Everyday Champions Award 2009 comprises three categories:

**Individuals**
<br>
These are your everyday Singaporeans who are dedicated to supporting others like their friends and family members in their sporting pursuits. They possess a burning passion and have a love for their sport. They motivate, inspire and inject zest to the lives of others by encouraging and empowering them to engage in sports.

**Coaches**
<br>
These coaches go the extra mile and give of themselves beyond their expected roles and responsibilities. They are both mentor and friend, nurturing in others the same passion they have for their sport, bringing out the best in them both on and off the playing field. This has two sub-categories - Development Coaches, who work with athletes at school or club level, and Performance Coaches, who train athletes or teams at National level.

**Organisations**
<br>
These are organisations that go beyond their core businesses to facilitate and build an active sports culture at work.

All individuals and organisations will be assessed based on their contributions to sports from 1 January 2007 to 31 July 2008. All nominees must fulfil requirements from their respective award categories as stipulated by SSC. Details of these requirements can be obtained online at http://www.singaporesports.sg/posbchampions
