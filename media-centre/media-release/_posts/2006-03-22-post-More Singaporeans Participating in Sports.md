<h3><strong>More Singaporeans Participating in Sports</strong></h3>
<p>The notion that 'sports means health and health means wealth' is gaining
increasing acceptance in Singapore, judging from the results of the Singapore
Sports Council's (SSC) latest 2005 National Sports Participation Survey
(NSPS). In the past five years, the sports arena in Singapore has not only
experienced an increase in participation levels, but the variety of sports
played has also broadened.</p>
<p>The incidence of regular sports participants has risen since the last
NSPS conducted in 2001. The 2005 survey revealed that 48% of Singaporeans
participate in some form of sports/exercise at least once a week, with
more than half (25%) doing so at least three times per week. Singaporeans
are also engaging in a wider variety of sports, such as gym workouts, in-line
skating and beach volleyball.</p>
<p>Daniel Metcalfe, Chief, Industry Development and High Participation at
SSC said: "We are very encouraged by the 48% sports participation rate
as it is an increase of 10% from 2001. More significantly, the increase
in the variety of sports played means that Singaporeans are now keen to
try out different types of sports. This shift in participation patterns
presents unique opportunities for SSC and its partners to engage Singaporeans
to participate in sports outside of the 'traditional' types of sports.
The combined increase in participation rate and interest in a wider variety
of sports suggests that sports is becoming a lifestyle option of choice
in Singapore."</p>
<p>The regular sports participation rate has improved significantly across
all age-categories. The most impressive increase was among the young adults,
registering a growth rate of 38%. Middle-aged adults and teens also performed
impressively with growth rates of 26% and 22% respectively. Comparatively,
the Senior Citizens category experienced a more modest growth of 12%. The
survey also revealed an increase of 10% female participation in sports
from 32% in 2001 to 42% in 2005.</p>
<p>The popularity of sports varies among different groups and reveals certain
patterns, motivations and needs behind sports participation. For teens,
there is a greater emphasis on team/competitive sports while the senior
citizens displayed a preference for low-intensity sports that are less
strenuous. Yoga and rhythmic exercise is popular amongst females while
males prefer soccer/football and fishing.</p>
<p>Overall, the top three most popular sports in Singapore are jogging, swimming
and walking. Yoga has moved from 19th position in 2001 to 10th position
in 2005. This is consistent with the findings that 22% - a sharp increase
of 17% from 2001 of the respondents participated in Sports as part of their
lifestyle.</p>
<p>The NSPS is nationwide research conducted by the SSC once every five years.
Its primary objective is to gauge the level of sports participation and
recreational physical activity in Singapore.</p>
