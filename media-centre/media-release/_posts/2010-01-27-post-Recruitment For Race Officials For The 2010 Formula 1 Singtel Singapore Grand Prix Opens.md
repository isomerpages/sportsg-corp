### **Recruitment For Race Officials For The 2010 Formula 1 Singtel Singapore Grand Prix Opens**

**Singapore, 27 January 2009** - Motorsports enthusiasts can now sign up as a volunteer to be one of the race officials for the 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX. The recruitment drive for race officials, administered by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), began on 25 January 2010 and will close on 26 February 2010.

2. The SSC is looking to recruit a total of 950 officials for the third installment of the 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX. While the SSC is expecting the return of some 600 race officials from the previous years' races, it hopes to train new blood and share the expertise and experience of being part of the world's only Formula One night race. Interested participants can look forward to being assigned to trackside roles such as observers, track marshals and flag marshals.

3. Volunteers can register their interest to be a race official via the official website, http://raceofficials.singaporegp.sg. Successful applicants will be notified of their selection by end March 2010.

4. "Singapore is fast becoming known as a sports events hub, therefore it is essential for us to continue to build our manpower capabilities across a broad spectrum of sports events, including motor sports. With the upcoming Changi Motorsports Hub, motorsports officials will definitely be in demand in years to come so as to support the growing local motorsports industry," said Kenneth Hui, Chief of Sports Facilities Group, Singapore Sports Council.

5. "This year, the Singapore Sports Council hopes to share the invaluable experience we have had over the past two years managing the manpower deployment for the Singapore Grand Prix. The previous two installments of the FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX attracted global interest and we believe many motorsports enthusiasts are looking forward to the return of Formula One only night race this September. We definitely hope to see new faces who have come forward to volunteer their time to be part of this significant event," added Mr Hui.

6. Race Officials will go through extensive training sessions, both theory and practical, specifically tailored to each role. Trainee Race Officials can expect to go for approximately 7 days of training, most of which will be conducted over weekends. Training for the General Officials' Modules, where Trainee Race Officials can expect to be briefed and trained on safety aspects, Formula One Protocols and basic track and flag signals, is slated to begin in May 2010.

7. "It's wonderful to see the camaraderie between like-minded motorsport enthusiasts that continues well after each race. Over the past two races, the race officials have had the opportunity to learn from the very best and have benefited from their experience at the most prestigious motorsport event there is. This year will be no different, and with new rules, new teams and the return of Formula One legends, the 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX will definitely be an experience unlike any other," said Mr. Colin Syn, Deputy Chairman of Singapore GP Pte Ltd.
