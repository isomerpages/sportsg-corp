### **Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore gets facelift to commemorate its 15th Anniversary**

Singapore’s premier running event, Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS), will undergo a facelift with the introduction of key race updates, a new charity partner and a grown-up Kids Dash at Orchard Road.

Managing Director of event organiser Ironman Asia Geoff Meyer shared these updates at the SCMS Launch Roadshow. “Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore is the nation’s largest running event steeped in Singapore’s history, and culture, and we’re delighted to have the opportunity to enhance the event experience to commemorate this special year,” said Meyer.

**Key Race Changes**

For the first time, Orchard Road will be the main starting point for SCMS 2016 – the Kids Dash on 3 December (Saturday), and both Full and Half Marathons on 4 December (Sunday). Sunday’s Race Day will see multiple wave starts for Full and Half Marathons runners based on their estimated finishing time in order to ensure a smoother start.

“Enhancing the SCMS route is one of our priorities for 2016 – we want to improve the overall running experience and alleviate start-line congestion with multiple wave starts,” explained Meyer. “The anniversary year presents the opportunity for us to make improvements based on our runners’ feedback, and introduce new initiatives focused on deepening family and community ties.”

A morning event in 2015, Kids Dash 2016 will now flag off at 6pm outside Ngee Ann City. The popular Orchard Road will be closed for parents and supporters to witness 5,000 kids, aged 13 and under, donning Santa hats and racing amidst the Christmas lights along Singapore’s iconic street.

**SCMS: Building a caring and more resilient community together**

Since 2002, SCMS has built itself into an inclusive event involving runners and supporters from all walks of life. Over 5,000 volunteers and supporters come together each year to create the unique SCMS experience. SCMS has also made fundraising a key theme of its community engagement programme - Run for a Reason.

SCMS has contributed more than S$270,000 to SportCares, a Sport Singapore initiative established in 2012. Title sponsor Standard Chartered Bank has also raised over S$350,000 for its global charity, Seeing is Believing, and other sight-related charities in Singapore. Over S$2.8 million has been raised via the SCMS platform for local charities and partners including Autism Association of Singapore, Breast Cancer Foundation, Community Chest, Club Rainbow and GiveAsia.

To commemorate its 15th anniversary, SCMS renewed its partnership with Community Chest, inking a 3-year agreement to profile Sharity as its event charity ambassador. As Community Chest’s iconic mascot, Sharity advocates “Caring and Sharing” and raises empathy among the young to care for the less privileged and disadvantaged in our community.

“Standard Chartered has been a title sponsor of the Singapore Marathon since 2002 and this is an event which the Bank and our staff are very proud of. The Bank has always been a champion for employee volunteering and corporate giving, and it make sense to integrate these initiatives in SCMS,” said Judy Hsu, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank Singapore. “We look forward to working closely with Community Chest, our runners, supporters and partners to build a sustainable giving culture in Singapore.”

Commenting on this, Minister for Social and Family Development Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, who officiated the launch, said “Mass participation activities like SCMS can shape the well-being of a nation by promoting an active lifestyle, deepening community ties and building the spirit of being caring and resilient. It will help us build a society that cares for the needy, and cultivate the reciprocity of giving back. This is the Singapore society that we are all proud to be a part of.”

**Paying tribute to the runners, supporters and volunteers of SCMS**

The SCMS Launch roadshow is a 4-day exhibition where visitors can take a walk down memory lane at the marathon’s throwback exhibition. It showcases memorabilia from the past 14 races, including contributions from race ambassadors and loyal runners, and running stories from past and present.

Organisers will also be giving away 100 entry slots and 1,000 anniversary tees to members of the public through on-site activities and lucky draws. Interested runners can also get a free baseline fitness test to help them begin their training journey for the race in December.

Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO of Sport Singapore shared that “The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore has played a pivotal role in developing the local sporting and running landscape. The Marathon has matured, and we hope to leverage the strong foundations and work closely with new organisers Ironman Asia to enhance the event and race experience.”

Registration for the marathon begins today from 10am at the race website, fees for all categories have remained the same as last year. Standard Chartered cardholders stand to enjoy 15% off registration fee across all categories.
