Porsche has partnered with the SportCares Foundation to celebrate SG50 by giving back to the community. To kick-start the event, Porsche has auctioned a full-sized replica of their 919 Hybrid car for more than SGD140,000 in support of the SportCares Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Sport Singapore, which aims to use sport as a force for social good by empowering people in need. The donated amount will then be matched dollar-for-dollar by Sport Singapore with all proceeds going to SportCares.

2\. “Porsche has long been at the forefront of sporting excellence and innovation and we are delighted to have the opportunity to create and collaborate with them,” said Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO, Sport Singapore. “We thank them for their generous contribution and are honoured and heartened that they see the value in what Sport Singapore is doing through SportCares, using sport as a vehicle for social change. Sport Singapore will build on this support, and together with the volunteers, participants and partners, continually strive to make an enduring, positive impact on society.”

3\. Martin Limpert, Managing Director of Porsche Asia Pacific, said: “The rare 919 Hybrid mock up car was brought to the region, to create awareness of our comeback to Le Mans in 2014, as well as to emphasise our strong roots in motorsports – our spirit. The 919 Hybrid replica visited six countries in almost a year and has been well received. We are very pleased to receive overwhelming response from the auction and the final outcome is beyond our expectation. Porsche is pleased to have the opportunity to generate funds and help people in need, through SportCares. We are very thankful for the support and glad that the important design prototype has found a new home.”

4\. In commemoration of this partnership, 50 volunteers from SportCares, under the guidance of Nicholas Foo, a LEGO certified professional, came together on Saturday, 4 July, to build a LEGO mural featuring an exclusive Porsche model, which was specially created for the 50th Anniversary of Singapore. The process of building a one-of-a-kind LEGO mural not only gave participants a new and unique experience, but also served to build teamwork and focus – qualities that SportCares also aims to develop in participants through workshops and volunteering opportunities.

5\. Muhd Qusairy Bin Abdul Manaf (14 years old), who took part in the mural building project said, “I play football and volunteer for SportCares at swimming events. Even though I am nervous about doing new things, I’ve learnt to be brave through the SportCares programmes. I am excited about being part of this project because Porsche is one of the best brands in the world.”

6\. Speaking on her experience on building the mural, Lyla Medina Binte Kamzaruddin (11 years old), a participant of SportCares Love Singapore girls’ tennis programme said, “SportCares teaches me to work well with others. Putting together almost 50,000 pieces of LEGO bricks was not easy but we did it through teamwork and a lot of focus.”

7\. The model of the Porsche will be displayed at The Porsche Circuit event, along with the LEGO mural, on Friday, 24 July at Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre, Halls 401 – 402.

8\. In addition, courtesy of the Porsche Club Singapore members, 50 volunteers from SportCares will also get the chance to be driven around in the members’ Porsche cars, starting from Suntec City to various locations in central Singapore.
