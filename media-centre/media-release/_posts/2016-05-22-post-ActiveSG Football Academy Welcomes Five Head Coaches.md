### **ActiveSG Football Academy Welcomes Five Head Coaches**

In less than a week, the ActiveSG Football Academy will be kicking off the first run of its programme at five different ActiveSG venues around the country. Parents interested to find more information or sign their child up for the programme can do so online at [ActiveSG Football Academy](www.myactivesg.com/programmes/academy/football).

Heading the programme at the various venues will be five new head coaches with a wealth of coaching experience under their belt, announced the ActiveSG Football Academy today.

Joining Academy Principal Aleksandar Duric will be - Richard Bok, Robin Chitrakar, Hyrizan Jufri, Mohamad Hairil Amin and Steven Tan – who will be helming the programme respectively at the Serangoon Sports Centre, Queenstown Sports Centre, Jurong East Sports Centre, Woodlands Sports Centre and the Kallang Cricket Field. As head coaches, the five of them will work with a team of assistant coaches to conduct the programme and monitor the progress of the participants.

Mr Duric said, “We are delighted to secure our head coaches. These five head coaches have been carefully selected based on their track record in football coaching and experience working with youths. Many top football players in the country have worked with them before and I believe the children in our academy will blossom under their care – not just for football skills, but also the life skills needed to excel in whatever they do.”

Mr Richard Bok, 3-time S-League Coach of the Year winner and now academy head coach at Serangoon Sports Centre said, “I am excited to be part of this project. There are currently many Singaporean youths who love football but do not have the opportunities to play and appreciate the sport better, especially if they are not in their school team. The ActiveSG football academy can change that and play a crucial role in giving our children more playing time. With more children playing football, our talent pool for the national football team will also expand.”

Mr Steven Tan, Technical director of local F-17 Football Academy and now academy head coach at Kallang Cricket Field said, “It is important for the coach to foster a strong coach-player relationship with the children so he knows exactly how to help them improve and grow both as a player and as a person. This is something we all believe at the ActiveSG Football Academy and we promise that every participant of the academy who is willing to learn will take away plenty of benefits from the programme.”

Since the academy launched earlier last month, registration for the first run of the programme during the June holidays has been brisk with close to 200 sign-ups so far.

Mr Duric said, “Our programme will give these kids a well-deserved break from their studies. Additionally, the programme is flexible so parents can decide how much time they want their child to commit to football. Children serious in developing their football education can attend up to three classes a week. Children who prefer to try out other sports or activities can choose to attend once a week.”

Suitable for both boys and girls, the inaugural academy programme will begin on 28 May and will take place over five weeks during the June school holidays. Participants can choose to attend up to three sessions a week. To make the programme accessible for Singaporeans, the programme will be held at five ActiveSG venues island-wide. Priced at only $130, the programme is currently one of the most affordable football academy programmes in Singapore.
