### **A Hybrid GetActive 2021 to celebrate 56th birthday and support our Team Spore contingent in Tokyo**

**Singapore, 23 July 202**1 – With the return to Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), GetActive! Singapore 2021 (GASG 2021) will now go virtual! Referencing this year’s National Day Parade’s theme - “Together Our Singapore Spirit”, GASG 2021 will feature fitness and dance workshops, live event streaming and online campaigns that will see the community participating together, in true SG United spirit.

GASG 2021 will be launched online by Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law later this evening at 6.00pm. This year’s edition includes a “Start With 60” campaign that encourages everyone to keep fit and healthy, with at least 60 seconds of exercise each day. During the launch, Minister Tong will join the online sporting fraternity comprising Team Singapore athletes, ex-Olympians, SportCares beneficiaries, and Team Nila volunteers, to perform the GASG 2021 Workout, demonstrating how keeping fit can be easy and fun. Minister Tong will also be calling on the community to support our Team Singapore contingent in Tokyo. The public may also do so by penning their well wishes for the athletes through a digital well-wishing mechanism.

The opening of the GASG 2021 campaign will kick start a series of sporting activities designed for all ages and abilities, till the end of August. “It has been a challenging year, but it has given us the impetus to develop creative and diverse ways for the community to stay active, while conforming to the prevailing Safe Management Measures. More than ever, GetActive! Singapore at this time, provides an all-important platform to uplift communities and inspire the belief and confidence that together, we will emerge stronger,” said Sport Singapore Chief Executive Officer Lim Teck Yin.

<u>**COMPONENTS OF GASG 2021 (VIRTUAL)**</u>

**GASG 2020 Active Enabler Programmes (AEP)**<br>
One of the key components of GASG is the Active Enabler Programme (AEP) - a community-oriented initiative that supports ground-up proposals for creative, sport-oriented activities centred around active lifestyles. Over the years, AEP has supported over 1,000 ground-up projects from individuals, schools, community, and corporate partners. This year, Singaporeans can look forward to a wide spectrum of exciting virtual activities to stay active and socially connected. The AEP initiatives will be extended till the end of August.

**GASG Workout**<br>
The GASG Workout 2021 aims to reach out, engage and uplift the community. This year’s workout will be part of National Day Parade (NDP) 2021’s Dance of the Nation initiative, which invites public to also submit their own dance-workout videos. Schools participating in this competition may also opt-in to be part of the National Day Parade collation, where selected submissions will be shared across NDP's social channels (applicable for entries submitted between 5 - 26 July 2021). The competition is open to all registered schools in Singapore, including Primary Schools, Secondary Schools, Institutes of Higher Learning, Special Education Schools, Madrasahs, and International Schools. Top 3 winners from each category and first 80 participating entries will receive attractive prizes. Submission period began on 5 July and will close on 15 August 2021.

**Nurture Kids Campaign (with elements from the Olympic Motto: “Faster, Higher, Stronger”!)**<br>
Kiddolympics 2021 is a campaign open to all preschools and families to participate. Registered preschools and families will gain access to themed challenge activity resources, which will equip educators and parents with useful knowledge, to engage the pre-schoolers with exciting Fundamental Movement Skills activities infused with modified sport elements. The finale, which will take place on 5 Aug 2021 via a virtual platform, will begin with the National Day Observance Ceremony, Kiddolympics torch relay, GASG 2021 Workout – Dance of the Nation, and conclude with the grand finale activities.

**Seniors’ Sports Day (Inaugural)**<br>
Seniors’ Sports Day, for those aged 40 years and above (for masters and seniors), will see the community coming together to pledge to achieve 56,000 minutes of physical activity. More than 20,000 minutes and counting, let us keep the spirit up and rally on! All masters and seniors are welcome to join the National Day Observance Ceremony and perform the GASG Workout on 7 August 2021 from 9.00am to 10.00am. Online workshops for pickleball, qi gong and table tennis (TTX), will also be available. 

**GameOn Nila**<br>
Adventure seekers and nature lovers can participate in GASG through GameOn Nila, the in-app game within the ActiveSG app. Participants can redeem up to $5000 worth of prizes by completing tasks at selected nature discovery trails in Singapore including hiking at MacRitchie and East Coast parks, kayaking and cycling around the island.

**Pesta Sukan**<br>
Pesta Sukan will continue to promote camaraderie through friendly competitions and encourage future generations to live better through sport, for the month of August. While most of the Pesta Sukan programmes will be cancelled or postponed, six selected Pesta Sukan events will continue in a revised hybrid format with both virtual and physical elements between 1 – 31 Aug, subject to the prevailing Safe Management Measures. There will be a series of “SG56 Celebrations” with a 56KM Run and 5.6KM swim at ActiveSG Stadiums and Swimming Complexes respectively. Public can also look forward to participating in a Round Island Bike Adventure and programmes such as the Nature Discovery Walk &amp; Paddle and Taekwondo (Poomsae), just to name a few.
All GASG participants are encouraged to share memorable sporting memories on social media with the hash tags #GetActiveSG and #PlayOnPlayTogether. More event details can be found on [https://go.gov.sg/getactivesingapore](https://go.gov.sg/getactivesingapore).

**Get Behind Our Athletes**<br>
As Singaporeans get up, and get active, and connect with one another, we recognise that this is a significant period, where 33 of our athletes will be striving to put Singapore on the most prestigious sporting pedestal – Tokyo Olympics 2020 and Tokyo Paralympics 2020. “Our Team Singapore athletes have shown much perseverance and resilience in taking on and overcoming the challenges of COVID-19, to represent us at the Olympics and Paralympics. Let us unite as one voice and one spirit to root for our athletes as a show of support and solidarity. This is made more special as it coincides with National Day and together, we can look forward to celebrating our nation’s birthday, in a meaningful manner,” added Mr Lim.
