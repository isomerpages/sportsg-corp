Alternative Dispute Resolution Framework for Sports formed to resolve disputes
statics0
Singapore, 7 January 2008 - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has taken another bold step to reinforce Singapore's position as a leading sports hub. Today, Singapore's first-ever Framework for Alternative Dispute Resolution for Sports (ADR Sports) to resolve sports disputes was officially launched with the signing of a memorandum of understanding among several parties at a signing ceremony held at SSC.

Enhancement of professional practices and organisational excellence in NSAs

2 The ADR Sports is an initiative spearheaded by the SSC and developed in collaboration with the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC), the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators (SIArb). It aims to resolve problems faced by NSAs in areas such as athlete selections, discipline and contractual disputes. To do so, the ADR Sports will leverage on existing arbitral and mediation institutes rules, systems, expertise and reputation in resolving disputes. Relationships are hence preserved due to confidentiality.

3 Mr Teo Ser Luck, Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) said, "Disputes are not uncommon between athletes and the NSAs. Through collaboration with the SMC, SIAC, SIArb and the SNOC, this initiative will further strengthen Singapore's position as a global hub for best sports practices. I strongly urge the NSAs to make use of this opportunity to adopt best-of-market management practices to enhance professional practices and organisational excellence."

4 In the majority of the cases, resolution should be implemented within the internal processes of the NSAs. However, should they be unsuccessful, the affected parties can refer the matter to the ADR Sports for mediation and arbitration for a conclusive resolution. All information exchanged during mediation and arbitration will be kept strictly confidential.


Enhancing Singapore's position as a global sports hub for alternative dispute resolution

5 The availability of the ADR Sports will also enhance Singapore's attractiveness with best practices in the area of dispute resolution. This is also synergistic with Singapore's commitment to develop the sports industry's ADR infrastructure and services, as they are able to support various thrusts such as:

a) A vibrant international sporting calendar
b) An increase in sports expertise taking up residency in Singapore
c) Potential growth of sports businesses
d) Potential growth of professional sports/marquee events
e) Growth in other supporting services such as sports law

6 Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer of SSC commented, "The SSC is pleased to have spearheaded this initiative for NSAs and the athletes in a professional way. This is a significant milestone for us. I strongly encourage all the NSAs and athletes to leverage on expertise from the SMC, SIAC and SIArb to resolve the disputes. Together, let us work to put Singapore on the world's sporting map, carving a reputation as a global hub for arbitration."

7 It is compulsory for all NSAs to adopt the ADR Sports. A workshop will be organised in the near future to assist the NSAs who require assistance on implementation.
