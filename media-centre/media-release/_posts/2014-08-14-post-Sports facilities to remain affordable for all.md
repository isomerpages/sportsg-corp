### **Sports facilities to remain affordable for all**

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents will enjoy public sports facilities at preferential rates with the implementation of a new fee structure in early 2015. Under this new structure, Singaporeans will continue to pay prevailing rates, while non-residents will be charged a new Standard rate.

2\. Said Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, Sport Singapore: “This move signals our commitment to provide sporting opportunities and programmes that are affordable and easily accessible to all. Singaporeans will not pay more than what they are paying now. We have also benchmarked the new fee structure against other Government-subsidised efforts to ensure that our sports facilities continue to remain affordable to everyone.”

**ActiveSG continues to receive encouraging response**

3\. Meanwhile, Singapore’s national movement for sport – ActiveSG – continues to receive encouraging response from the public, with membership count hitting close to 500,000 just months after its launch in April this year. This follows the introduction of unconventional activities such as Masala Bhangra® and Aqua Spinning, as well as creative concepts such as outdoor poolside gyms, among others. These have contributed to an estimated increase of 20% in gym and pool visitorship.

4\. The ActiveSG$100 that was extended to all members has also been well received. To date, more than 60% of members have gone on to utilise their credits, with the purchase of swim and gym entry passes as well as the booking of sports facilities being among the top few transactions.

**Sports Hub to make rates available from 15 August 2014**

5\. The Singapore Sports Hub is an example of a sports facility that will take after the new fee structure when it starts charging for the use of its facilities, come 18 August. This follows more than a month of free play, where the public got to experience the new Sports Hub facilities for an extended period in celebration of Singapore’s 49th birthday.

6\. The Sports Hub will be making the rates of its facilities available on its  [website](http://www.sportshub.com.sg) from 15 August. Said SportsHub Pte Ltd Chief Executive Officer Mr Philippe Collin Delavaud: “The Singapore Sports Hub works closely with Sport Singapore on key decisions, including determining the rates for the usage of Sports Hub facilities. Sports Hub patrons can be assured that our rates will be competitive with other sports facilities across the island, and in line with Sport Singapore’s pricing policy.”
