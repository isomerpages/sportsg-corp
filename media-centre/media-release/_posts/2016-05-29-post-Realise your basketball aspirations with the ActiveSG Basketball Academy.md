<h3><strong>Realise your basketball aspirations with the ActiveSG Basketball Academy</strong></h3>
<p>Sport Singapore continues to demonstrate its commitment towards building
a stronger community and making sports affordable and accessible with the
launch of the ActiveSG Basketball Academy. The third in the series of ActiveSG
clubs/academies, the ActiveSG Basketball Academy will see a tripartite
partnership between Sport Singapore, Basketball Association of Singapore
(BAS) and the Singapore Slingers; and will encompass a deliberately carved
pathway for children and youths to develop their talent and nurture their
passion for the sport.</p>
<p>Says Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, Sport Singapore, “Basketball
continues to be amongst the top 10 sports in Singapore, being played widely
in schools and at a community level. The ActiveSG Basketball Academy will
seek to complement the efforts of the BAS and Singapore Slingers in encouraging
participation, raising the quality of coaching and programmes, and nurturing
a calendar of leagues and competitions for all ability levels. All our
academies and clubs will give emphases to developing transferable life
skills too."</p>
<p><strong>A partnership that delivers new value for basketball enthusiasts</strong>
</p>
<p>A partnership between Sport Singapore, Basketball Association of Singapore
and the Singapore Slingers, the ActiveSG Basketball Academy will be helmed
by Principal, former national coach Neo Beng Siang and will provide a continuous
pathway for everyone – from kids, to youths to working adults, to realise
their potential and to engage in the sport.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Says Mr Ong Swee Teck, Honorary Secretary, Basketball Association of Singapore,
“BAS is happy to partner ActiveSG in providing more opportunities for the
community to play basketball. The mission of the ActiveSG Basketball Academy
is in line with the aspirations of our Association to bring the sport of
basketball to everyone. We want to make playing basketball more accessible
at all levels of our community. We look forward to working with the team
to promote a more dynamic basketball culture in Singapore.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suitable for both boys and girls, the Academy programme will be priced
at S$130 and will be conducted over 10 weeks, three sessions per week.
As part of the programme, all youth up to secondary school level will be
able to learn and play at a recreational level while working adults will
be offered more leagues and locations to play at a recreational level,
regardless of their skill level or club affiliation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Underpinning the sport curricula will be Sport Singapore’s expertise in
the area of character development through sport to provide a more holistic
programme for participants. It is envisioned that youth who pass through
the Academy will develop life skills such as resilience, discipline, team
work and respect; and at the same time, be future ready through sport by
displaying leadership skills and personal values that parents, teachers
and future employers value.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Says Principal of the ActiveSG Basketball Academy Neo Beng Siang, “The
ActiveSG Basketball Academy is unique in that it is not only about imparting
the skills of the sport, but also about developing one’s character and
values through basketball. Basketball has always been a huge part of my
life, having been involved in the basketball scene for a long time. I am
looking forward to sharing my experience and working with the team to create
an Academy where those who have undergone the training can develop correct
attitude and sustain their own passion for the sport. Who knows, we might
one day have a next upcoming international basketball star in our midst.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Commencing in September 2016, the ActiveSG Basketball Academy will have
sessions conducted in five centres islandwide – Choa Chu Kang Sports Centre,
Clementi Sports Centre, Delta Sports Centre, Hougang Sports Centre and
Pasir Ris Sports Centre.</p>
