For the next phase of growth, SSC will drive a national holistic and integrated approach to enable NSAs to systematically identify, develop and optimise the performance of elite athletes, coaches and officials across the development pathway. Bob's wealth of management and technical experience at the strategic, tactical and operations level, established networks with the international sporting fraternity and strong ability to build partnerships will help us put in place a national organisational excellence and high performance framework to enable NSAs to achieve sustained competitive excellence at the international level.

* NGBs in the USA are the equivalent of National Sports Associations (NSA) in Singapore.

* MEMOS was founded in Europe in 1995 upon the initiative of several National Olympic Committees, the European Network of Sport Sciences in Higher Education, several universities, and with the financial support of Olympic Solidarity and the European Union Socrates programme. The aim of MEMOS was to provide a higher level of training to European sport managers. In the summer of 2002, the MEMOS Steering Committee voted to adapt the programme for participation internationally. Currently, more than one hundred MEMOS graduates are working in Olympic sports organisations.
