### **WTA Stars Raise $25000 For A Good Cause**
Stars of the WTA donated their time today in support of SportCares Foundation at the Play with the Stars & Play for Change charity fundraiser at the OCBC Arena practice courts.  
  
WTA stars, Martina Hingis and Martina Navratilova, got on court with young tennis players from Singapore, thanks to corporate donors who had pledged S$5,000 each to SportCares, a philanthropic foundation that activates sport for social good.  
  
“Today’s fundraiser showcases the potential for sport to bring together different aspects of our society,” says Richard Seow, Chairman, Sport Singapore. “Young players were given a golden opportunity to play some of the finest tennis players the world has ever seen, thanks to the generosity of the WTA stars and the support of donors who believe in the power of sport to do social good.”  
  
The proceeds from this fundraiser will help SportCares continue to make a real difference in the lives of children and youth living in hardship. SportCares has been able to reach more than 12,000 children and youth from low-income backgrounds through its holistic sports programming, including its Love Singapore tennis programme for girls. With support from both individuals and the corporate sector, SportCares aims to help more people live better through sport.  
  
Melissa Pine, Vice-President of WTA Asia-Pacific and Tournament Director of the BNP Paribas WTA Finals Singapore presented by SC Global, said, “Our players are great role models and we are glad that they gave their time today to a cause that has such great synergy with the WTA. Tennis can bring so many benefits and we are glad to be part of such a meaningful endeavor through our work with SportCares.”
