### **Over 2,400 participants joined the National Day celebrations at the GetActive! Singapore 2022 and Olympic Day Walk**

Let’s Play On, Play Together to celebrate our nation’s 57th birthday at the Sports Hub, ActiveSG Sport Centres and selected heartland spaces  
  
**Singapore, 30 July 2022** – In its seventh edition, GetActive! Singapore 2022 (GASG) continues to proliferate the Singapore Spirit through sport in conjunction with the nation’s birthday. Kicking off with the Olympic Day Walk at the OCBC Square (Sports Hub), GASG 2022 will see a full swing of in-person mass participation events and sport competitions across the island.

2. “Over the years Get ActiveSG has delivered multiple opportunities to encourage all to celebrate our nation’s birthday with family, friends and fellow Singaporeans. This year we have another strong line-up of events and programmes island-wide for Singaporeans and residents and today’s Olympic Day Walk is an apt start to the celebrations,” Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer of Sport Singapore (SportSG).

3. Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth & Second Minister for Law  
officially launched the GASG 2022 and flagged off the Olympic Day Walk. He was joined by Mr Kon Yin Tong, Chairman of Sport Singapore (SportSG) and Mr Lee Wung Yew, President of Olympians Singapore and former Team Singapore athlete. Participants started the morning’s Olympic Day Walk warming up to the GetActive! Singapore Workout, moving to the beat of this year’s National Day song ‘Stronger Together’ led by ActiveSG Sport Champions.  
Team Singapore sailors Cecelia Low and Kimberly Lim delivered the Olympic Day message and assisted in the lighting of the Torch for the walk. Minister Edwin Tong joined the participants for a 3km walk around the Sports Hub and the Kallang Alive precinct. Appropriate Safe Management Measures were undertaken for the launch and Olympic Day Walk event segments.

**It’s all happening at GetActive! Singapore 2022**

4. Taking place from 30 July to 7 August 2022, GASG events and programmes will take place at the Singapore Sports Hub, ActiveSG Sport Centres and selected heartland spaces. Everyone, regardless of age and abilities, have opportunities to enjoy sport in celebration of our National Day.  
  
5. One of the motivations for GASG this year will be accommodating to the demand to participate in person and bringing back fun through activities beyond the traditional form of sport. For example, this year, we have introduced the special NDP 2022 Adventure edition on GameOn and stand a chance to win prizes for those who want to clock their steps while exploring Singapore.

6. This year, family friendly GetActive! Sport Festivals organised by Team Nila volunteers will take place at 10 selected ActiveSG facilities and at Chinatown. Our budding community athletes have been competing in the Pesta Sukan. 24 sports, 13 para sports and 5 signature events have started with some to start later. This will be the largest community multi-sports competition for Singaporeans since the pandemic.  
  
7. At the Sports Hub, an extravaganza of dance and adrenaline sports will be on offer. YouthCreates Urban Fiesta will provide youths with workshops and competition at OCBC Square. All these against the backdrop of mesmerising dance feats by teams competing at the Lion City Dance Convention set to begin today till 7 August 2022.

8. Visitors can also check out the Active Health Experiential Booths and Make Every Move Count Workshops which will feature a series of simple assessments allowing people to learn more about their fitness and health status. Also happening at the OCBC Square will be a new Seniors Obstacle Course, a project supported by Active Enabler Programme to make functional movement and exercise more fun for our seniors.

9. The seventh edition of GetActive! Singapore will have events for everyone. For more information on any event or to review the line-up of GASG events, please visit: [GetActive!
