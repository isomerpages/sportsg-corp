## **The Search Begins For The Best Music Video For "Go! Go! Singapore!!"**

THE SEARCH BEGINS FOR THE BEST MUSIC VIDEO FOR "GO! GO! SINGAPORE!!"

**Singapore 23 September 2010** - Two days after the launch of "Go! Go! Singapore!!", the new cheer song released by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) aimed at getting Singaporeans to use their voices to rally behind Team Singapore, the SSC is now inviting members of the public to exercise their creativity by creating a music video to accompany the cheer song. The contest begins today and ends on 16 October 2010.

2. Performed by popular local A cappella group Juz-B, "Go! Go! Singapore!!" is a collaboration between the SSC, recording company Ocean Butterflies and members of the public, who through focus groups, played an important part in the composition of the lyrics, melody, beat and mix of the cheer.

3. This contest is in an effort to involve members of the public as much as possible with the new cheer, as they will be hugely responsible for chanting parts, if not the entire cheer song, at the sporting arenas while they cheer on our Team Singapore athletes.

4. "The Singapore Sports Council is thrilled that Singaporeans want to take ownership of the cheer, and are excited and happy to be involved in its production," said Ms Sharon Kam, Senior Director of Sports Marketing Group, SSC.

5. To participate in the contest, the public will have to download the song from [SingaporeSports.sg/cheerSG](SingaporeSports.sg/cheerSG), film their moves and grooves in a music video, upload it on Youtube and submit the link to the SSC. More details can be found on [SingaporeSports.sg/cheerSG](SingaporeSports.sg/cheerSG).

6. The contest starts begins on 22 September 2010 and will go on till 2359hrs on 16 October 2010. It is open to all Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents.

7. Each successful entry will receive a $20 shopping voucher. The grand prize winner will be announced on 31 October 2010, and the winning entry will walk away with an Apple iPad and $200 worth of shopping vouchers.
