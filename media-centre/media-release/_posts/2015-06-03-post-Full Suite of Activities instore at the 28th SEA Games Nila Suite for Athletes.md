### **Full Suite of Activities instore at the 28th SEA Games Nila Suite for Athletes**
During the 28th Southeast Asian Games, athletes from all 11 member federations will be able to rest and unwind in privacy at a first-class facility – the NILA Suite for Athletes, situated at the Kallang Theatre.

The 600-square metre NILA Suite will be managed by staff from members of the SportCares Foundation and the Foundation’s partners. The SportsCares Foundation is a social development initiative which supports children and youth from all segments of the community to use sport as a social tool.

Located just steps away from competition venues at the Singapore Sports Hub, the NILA suite provides athletes with a place to unwind, get to know one another and take a break from the heat of the competition.

Named after the sporting lion mascot for the 28th SEA Games, the NILA Suite boasts features such as a well-stocked canteen with healthy, nutritious snacks; a tech space with laptops, power points; and access to Wi-Fi. Athletes can also engage in friendly competition at the fully equipped games area or showcase their musical abilities during karaoke or music jam sessions.

A separate room will house massage chairs, sponsored by Osim, for more opportunities for rest and relaxation. While athletes lighten up during a game on the Xbox gaming console, they can also load their laundry in a dedicated laundry area with 17 washing machines.

Social media interaction is a key aspect of the Games, and the Nila Suite aims to incorporate interactive technology with social media. An instant photo booth will be available where traditional photo prints are printed simultaneously as the same photo is shared on social media. In collaboration with Facebook, the photo booth will also be Southeast Asia’s first ever “anti-gravity” photo booth zone, with a backdrop of Singapore’s iconic “Kopitiam” serve as the canvas for athletes to snap picture perfect Instagram moments with their new friends and to share with their old friends back home.

“We are excited to see the SportCares Team of players from the various programmes and staff coming together to support the Games in such a big way. The NILA Suite is a key touchpoint for athletes around the region to meet and forge lasting, enduring friendships and we are extremely delighted to play a role in inculcating these life-long connections,” said Laura Reid, Deputy Director, SportCares Foundation.

Not only does the NILA suite provide hands-on opportunities for SportCares participants to put their weeks of training and preparation to use, our participants are also given a chance to meet with their personal sporting heroes, hear their stories and get inspired for the future.”

“As an athlete who is competing at the 28th SEA Games, the NILA suite offers me opportunities to have some time to myself, to take my mind off the competition for a while to rest and relax, as well as mingle with fellow athletes from all over the region,” said Team Singapore fencer Ann Lee Huimin.
