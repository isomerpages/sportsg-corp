### **Rousing Welcome For Team Singapore Olympic Contingent**

Women's Table Tennis Players To Be Conferred Meritorious Service Medals For Historic Achievement

Team Singapore returned home today with new found confidence after creating sporting histories at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. To mark the country's most successful Olympic Games yet, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) held a celebration at Raffles City Shopping Centre this afternoon to commemorate Singapore's historic win and recognize this significant milestone in Singapore's sporting history.

Singapore's paddlers, Li Jiawei, Wang Yuegu and Feng Tianwei, brought an end to Singapore's 48-year Olympic medal drought when they clinched the silver medal in the Table Tennis Women's Team event. Another notable performance was by Olympic debutant, Tao Li, who made waves by being the first Singaporean swimmer to reach an Olympic final in the Women's 100m Butterfly event. Tao Li also set a new Asian record during the semi-finals.

"Our outstanding performance at this Olympic Games caps an unprecedented run of historical best performances and record medal haul by Team Singapore athletes at the four major games held over the last few years - the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games in 2006, and the 2007 SEA Games. Our Beijing Olympic team had the largest number of athletes who qualified on merit. These achievements are a strong testimony that Singapore's sports excellence programmes and in particular Project 0812, are moving in the right direction. Our achievements at this year's Olympics will spur us further to excel at future major games. Congratulations Team Singapore for your momentous win at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games!" said Mr Teo Chee Hean, Minister of Defence and President of Singapore National Olympic Council.

Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, who returned with the Team Singapore contingent, said "I am very proud of all our athletes. They all did their best, and flew our flag proudly. In particular, our women's table tennis team fulfilled our hopes for an Olympic medal after 48 years. I am pleased to announce that the Cabinet has decided to award the Meritorious Service Medal to Li Jiawei, Wang Yuegu and Feng Tianwei. I hope this award will also spur other athletes to continue to strive for national sporting glory."

This would be the third time the prestigious Meritorious Service Medal has been conferred on athletes. Mr Tan Howe Liang was conferred the Meritorious Service Medal in 1962 for winning a silver medal in weightlifting at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. Ms Joscelin Yeo was conferred the Meritorious Service Medal in 2006 for her sustained achievements in sports.

The Singapore contingent received rapturous applause as supporters welcomed them upon their arrival at Changi Airport this afternoon. Fellow Olympians from shooting, swimming and athletics, who had returned earlier in the week, also joined in welcoming the rest of the contingent back from Beijing.

Enroute to Raffles City Shopping Centre, Team Singapore made a detour to the heartland areas, where Singaporeans on the streets gave the contingent a rousing homecoming. Team Singapore passed by Chai Chee, Haig Road and Orchard Road, giving supporters the opportunity to welcome the athletes and officials home after a successful campaign at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.

The celebration at Raffles City Shopping Centre saw Singaporeans from all walks of life congratulating Team Singapore on their outstanding performance at the Games. Children from the SSC's SportOn Kids Club were also in attendance to give their cheers and congratulations to Singapore's Olympic contingent.

Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer, SSC commented, "Today's event celebrates a historic milestone for all of us. The achievements by our athletes also give Singaporeans the opportunity to show their support and appreciation to our athletes, who have flown the Singapore flag high at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games."

"All the athletes who represented the country have much to be proud of and will move forward to achieve even greater success. Team Singapore has pushed new boundaries at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. It is a significant milestone and our first step to achieving even greater sporting accomplishments at future major games and competitions. Now that we are all back from Beijing, it is time to regroup, reflect and build on these achievements as we prepare for London 2012," Mr Oon added.
