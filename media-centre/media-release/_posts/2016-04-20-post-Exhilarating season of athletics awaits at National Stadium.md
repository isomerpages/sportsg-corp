<h3><strong>Exhilarating season of athletics awaits at National Stadium</strong></h3>
<p>From 28 April to 8 May this year, Singaporeans will be in for an exhilarating
experience as the athletics season kicks off at the National Stadium. The
season will see four key events – Singapore Open Track and Field Championships,
National School Games Track and Field Finals, ActiveSG Athletics Fiesta,
and Asia Masters Athletics Championships – taking place consecutively for
the first time, providing a whole host of activities fit for all ages and
abilities.</p>
<p>Singapore Athletics (SA), Sport Singapore (SportSG), Ministry of Education
(MOE) and Singapore Sports Hub (SSH) have been in talks to stage these
events one after another this year, in hopes of inspiring the next generation
of athletes to strive towards excellence in athletics, driving public interest
and participation in the sport, as well as promoting active living. The
events also seek to welcome all members of the public to the National Stadium,
not just as spectators but also to take part in both competitive and fun-filled
events over the two days of the ActiveSG Athletics Fiesta.</p>
<p><strong>Aspirations for featuring events together</strong>
</p>
<p>In a collaborative effort, SA, SportSG and MOE, together with SSH, would
ensure the smooth running of each of their events and work closely together
to promote the season. With the exception of the biennale Asia Masters
whose hosting rights are subject to the bidding process, the organisers
hope to continue featuring their respective events together in subsequent
years.</p>
<p>SA President Mr Tang Weng Fei is proud to welcome athletes from the region
to the 78th edition of the Singapore Open as well as the 19th edition of
the Asia Masters Athletics Championships. He said: “This year, the programme
will be integrated with the National School Games Track and Field Finals.
This is truly an all-encompassing season of athletics which will see participation
from athletes aged 13 to 99. The opportunity to compete alongside some
of the region's best athletes in the iconic National Stadium at the Singapore
Sports Hub will surely inspire our local athletes to put in their best
during the competition.”</p>
<p>Director of MOE’s Student Development Curriculum Division, Ms Liew Wei
Li, said: “This collaboration will give both our student athletes and school
supporters the opportunity to learn from and be inspired by athletes beyond
the schools, such as the local and regional veterans from the Singapore
Open Track and Field Championships. Holding the National School Games Track
and Field Finals at the National Stadium will also allow more students
and parents to support the student athletes and share a thrilling and meaningful
experience.”</p>
<p>Said SportSG’s Chief Executive Officer Lim Teck Yin: “It is our aspiration
to eventually establish a series of quality events which all local and
even regional athletes gunning for glory in the track and field scene can
look forward to each year. We hope to inspire not just a generation of
great track and field athletes, but also a nation of proud and enthusiastic
supporters. This is not only about promoting excellence in athletics but
also getting people to become interested and participate in the sport –
whether as a competitor, spectator, volunteer, or to simply try it out.
Essentially, it is about helping Singaporeans to pick a sport; play a sport;
and eventually live better through sport.”</p>
<p>According to Manu Sawhney, Chief Executive Officer of SSH: “We are excited
to be the venue of choice for this series of athletic competitions. The
National Stadium is perfectly primed for events where professional and
amateur athletes as well as fans and the community, come to play and partake
of excellent sporting activity. We look forward to hosting athletes of
all ages and persuasion in an inspiring celebration of athletic excellence
at the Singapore Sports Hub.”</p>
