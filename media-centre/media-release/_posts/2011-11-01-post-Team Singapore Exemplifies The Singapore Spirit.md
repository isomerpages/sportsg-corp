### **Team Singapore Exemplifies The Singapore Spirit**

_Team Singapore Will Take Part in 33 Sports at the 26th SEA Games and Five Sports at the 6th ASEAN Para Games_

**Singapore, 1 November 2011** - A 14-year-old synchronised swimmer, a 76-year-old debutant, three Paralympians, seven pairs of siblings and a father-daughter waterski team. These are just some of the characters that will tell Team Singapore's story at the 26th SEA Games and 6th ASEAN Para Games in Indonesia this year.

2. At the flag presentation ceremony this evening at SCAPE, Guests-of-Honour Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean along with Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Mr Chan Chun Sing, presented the respective contingents with the Singapore flag, as symbol of honour, for them to take to the Games.

3. Reminding Team Singapore of the significant value and pride they bring not just to their respective sport, but to our country, DPM Teo said, "Team Singapore, through your effort, you exhibit the best of what Singapore stands for ? a determined, passionate and resilient society. Through your actions, you show our ASEAN neighbours that we have a strong motivation to win, coupled with a big heart to make friends. As we follow your progress, you will be our source of inspiration and pride. I applaud all of you for having the drive and spirit to be the best you can be and to do it for Singapore."

4. His words were exemplified in the choice of the Flag Bearer - nine-time SEA Games gold medallist discus thrower James Wong, whose perseverance and drive has led him to make a final appearance at the SEA Games in pursuit of his tenth gold medal. "It is always a privilege to be able to represent Singapore. This year will be extra special for me to be able carry the Singapore flag and lead the contingent at the opening ceremony, as it will be my last trip to the SEA Games. It is an absolute honour, and one that I am proud to bear," said James.

5. The Pledge Taker for the contingent was fencer Ruth Ng, who at 25 is a SEA Games veteran having competed in four previous editions. She is also striving to lead the women's foil team to their third consecutive team gold medal.

6. Comprising 414 athletes and 206 officials, the young contingent, with about half of the athletes being 21 years and younger will be led by Chef-de-Mission Dr Tan Eng Liang, to compete in 33 out of 42 sports at the upcoming SEA Games. Singapore will also be represented in bridge, open water swimming, roller sports and sport climbing for the very first time. Altogether, 257 athletes will be making their debut appearance at the biennial games.

##### **New Faces to the Games**

7. Having just turned 14 two weeks ago, synchronised swimmer Natalie Chen is the baby of the contingent. The secondary two student from CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh) who picked up the sport at the tender age of seven said, "Synchronised swimming started out just as a hobby for me, something that I enjoyed doing with my sisters. However after seven years, I am glad to now be representing Singapore for the first time at the SEA Games. This is something that I have trained very hard for, and I am very excited."

8. The oldest member of Team Singapore at the SEA Games is 76-year-old Ng Lai Chun who will be competing in bridge. The grandmother of five picked up the game 34 years ago and was triumphant at various international tournaments winning her the title of 'World Master' in 2009.

9. While Team Singapore has fielded many pairs of siblings at the SEA Games, this year, Team Singapore will be sending a father-daughter duo to the waterski competitions. 16-year-old Kayla Marisa Kee will make her debut at the SEA Games with her biggest fan in tow - her father, 47-year-old Geoffrey Kee. For the Kees, sporting excellence runs in the family. Kayla's mother May Win picked up a silver medal in waterski at the 1997 SEA Games in Jakarta and Kayla and Geoffrey will be hoping to add more medals to the mantel.

10. The talented roller sports team also hopes to begin their SEA Games medal collection as they make their debut this year. Led by former national ice hockey player Daniel Chew, the line-up includes national ice skater Lim June Liang, three-time national skating champion Daryl Chan and world freestyle skating champion Rebecca Chew.

11. "Team Singapore's contingent to the SEA Games this year boasts a promising mix of seasoned veterans and fresh young talent. We are confident that the athletes will do Singapore proud and deliver outstanding performances," said CDM Dr Tan.

##### **Paralympians to do Singapore proud**

12. Muhammad Firdaus Nordin, Singapore's first wheelchair racer to qualify for the Paralympic Games in Beijing 2008, will be racing for the Republic at the 6th ASEAN Para Games. The contingent of 36 athletes and 21 officials also includes swimmers Yip Pin Xiu and Theresa Goh who have both qualified for the London 2012 Paralympics. Of the young athletes making their debut at the 6th ASEAN Para Games, almost all of them are under 21 years of age.

13. "Our para athletes have gone through grueling preparations and will face new challenges and difficulties at the Games. They are an immense inspiration to our nation and their will to perform their very best at the Games epitomises the human spirit's strength and resolve. I am sure that their strong perseverance and determination will come through in Solo and they can bring back the medals they seek," said Mr Ee Tiang Hwee, Chef-de-Mission for Team Singapore to the 6th ASEAN Para Games.

##### **Following Team Singapore's Action on New Media**

14. Team Singapore's Facebook page and website (www.teamsingapore.com.sg) will also provide fans with updates during key events at the Games, quotes, results and photographs of Team Singapore athletes in action. Members of the public are also encouraged to send in their well-wishes and dedicate the values they feel best represent the Singapore Spirit for the athletes to take to the Games on both Facebook and the Team Singapore website.
