<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 6 FEBRUARY 2024 </strong>– The Singapore Youth League
(SYL), co-organised by the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) and
Sport Singapore (SportSG), was officially launched at the National Stadium.</p>
<p>The league, an initiative under the <em>Unleash the Roar! </em>(UTR!) national
football project, is Singapore’s inaugural nation-wide elite youth football
competition and is set to feature over 200 registered teams from 52 clubs
and academies across various age groups. The list of participating teams
includes St Michaels’ Soccer Association, Flair Football Academy, the Singapore
Premier League’s Lion City Sailors, and invited teams the likes of Malaysia’s
Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT).</p>
<p>The league will kick off on the weekend of 24 and 25 February 2024, with
matches being played at various stadiums across the island.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Youth League: A firm foundation for talent development</strong>
</p>
<p>The SYL is designed to provide aspiring youth players a robust, competitive
platform to gain match experience during their developmental years and
showcase their talent. To this end, the SYL provides youth players regular
matches against opposition at a similar level of football, in an inclusive
league that is aimed at individual development in terms of football skills
as well as sporting values.</p>
<p>The league, open to both boys and girls, will cater to six age groups
(Under-8, Under-10, Under-12, Under-13, Under-15, and Under-17) and serve
as the primary pipeline for future Singapore internationals, with nearly
3,800 youth players competing in about 1,100 matches per season.</p>
<p>Prior to the inaugural season, teams will undergo an initial classification
round of matches to help determine their level. Based on the results of
the classification round, teams will be placed in divisions consisting
of sides of similar strength for the league proper. The SYL will include
a promotion/relegation feature across all age groups, where teams can move
up or down divisions based on performance.</p>
<p>Youth teams will compete in an annual season spanning approximately eight
months, with a mid-year break in between. Teams in the SYL will play an
average of about 30 games per season – more than any other youth league
in the past. And because of the league’s classification system, these matches
will pit teams of similar levels against each other, ensuring that competitive
balance is maintained throughout the season.</p>
<p>The SYL follows a programming matrix which ensures that each age group
plays the recommended required number of games for the continued development
of youth footballers in Singapore.</p>
<p>Through the league, SPL clubs – that are also represented in the competition
– can scout for players, opening pathways into professional football for
the SYL’s best.</p>
<p>“If Singapore is to have a footballing future, it is clear that the fundamental
thing we need is a structured development system for our children that
will bring them to greater heights. Like in many other sports, development
must start from a young age, and must be built upon best practices even
while it is adapted to the Singapore context,” said FAS President, Bernard
Tan, who spoke at the SYL’s official launch at the Singapore Sports Hub’s
OCBC Lounge.</p>
<p>“The SYL that is built on five key pillars – regular matches, competition
at the right level, emphasis on development over results, inculcation of
sporting values, and inclusivity – aims to do this at scale.”</p>
<p>FAS Technical Director Michael Browne said, “Consistent and regular competitive
matches against opposition of a similar standard is vital for the development
of young footballers. And with the SYL bringing local academies, SPL clubs
and even foreign teams together, what we will see is an ecosystem that
supports all levels, and one that gives Singapore a pipeline of talent
on a clear pathway from the grassroots to the elite level. And this is
a sturdy platform for player growth and for the overall growth of the game
in the country.”</p>
<p>The SYL will also provide a platform for the development of women’s football
in Singapore. Clubs can register all-girls teams that will play one age
category lower— this means they will compete against boys one to two years
younger.</p>
<p>Four all-girls teams – two from the Junior National Development Centre
(JNDC) and two from the National Development Centre (NDC) – will feature
when the SYL kicks off later this month.</p>
<p><strong>Shaping the future of football</strong>
</p>
<p>Besides the invited academies – that include JDT, the ActiveSG Football
Academy and the Singapore Sports School – all other clubs and academies
that will participate in the SYL are part of the FAS’ Academy Accreditation
System (AAS).</p>
<p>The AAS’ 13-point criteria ensures that clubs and academies provide a
robust structure for youth development. This, along with the competitive
environment the SYL provides, are key contributors to the UTR! aim of uplifting
Singapore football.</p>
<p>Additionally, all participating players will have an Individual FAS Youth
Player Profile offering national coaches and scouts valuable insights for
selection of players into the National Development Centre (NDC) and unearthing
the future of Singapore’s national team.</p>
<p>"The SYL reinforces our support towards developing all levels of Singapore
football. Through the SYL we are going back to basics, revitalising our
grassroots, and nurturing the untapped potential of our youth talent,”
said SportSG Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Toh Boon Yi.</p>
<p>“We are confident the SYL will provide a robust platform for our young
talents to flourish. More than just a football league, it is a manifestation
of our commitment to building a pipeline that will contribute to Singapore
football – and the local sporting fabric – for years to come,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Football fraternity excited to get started</strong>
</p>
<p>Soaring Dreams Football Academy Director Deniel Ong, believes that the
SYL augurs well for the future of youth football in Singapore. “As an academy
director, and more importantly a die-hard Singapore football fan, I believe
that the SYL is a big step forward in increasing the level of participation
and standards amongst the youth here in Singapore.”</p>
<p>His views were echoed by Ibrahim Chemad, Director of Flair Football Academy,
which has been in operation since 2019.</p>
<p>"I’m excited about the enhanced playing opportunities that our players
will enjoy in the upcoming SYL season,” he said. “While we are obviously
targeting success in the league for our participating teams, our broader
focus is on the holistic development of each player as they grow and excel
in the game.”</p>
<p>For nine-year-old Kieron Ong who will play in the U10 category for Soaring
Dreams Football Academy, there is palpable excitement in the lead up to
kick-off.</p>
<p>“I am looking forward to playing with and against many of my friends in
the SYL. I know that the games are going to be difficult, but I want to
play against the strongest players and show what I can do,” said Kieron.</p>
<p>“Maybe I can also get spotted by scouts and play for Singapore one day.
Hopefully we can win the league!”</p>
<p>The inaugural season of the Singapore Youth League will run from 24 February
– 1 December 2024. The league will crown champions across every age group
after 33 match days of competition.</p>
