<p><strong>Singapore, 1 June 2012</strong> - The Singapore Sports Council
(SSC) in partnership with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), McDonald's
and the National Library Board (NLB) launched a three-month long campaign
today to gather 200,000 well-wishes from the public for Team Singapore
to take to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>2. The campaign was launched with the unveiling of a mural of seven athletes
designed by students from ITE to commemorate Team Singapore's participation
at the London 2012 games. After unveiling the mural, the guest-of-honour,
Madam Halimah Yacob, Minister of State for Community Development, Youth
and Sports, penned her well-wishes for Team Singapore alongside Ms Jessie
Phua, Chef de Mission (CDM) for the London 2012 Olympic Games, Mr Frankie
Thanapal Sinniah PBM BBM, CDM for the London 2012 Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>3. The theme of this year's national well-wishing campaign, "Ignite your
Support", centres around the Team Singapore well-wishing mobile portal
www.supportteamsingapore.sg. It is at this portal where Singaporeans will
be able to find out more about our athletes headed to London, send in their
well-wishes, as well as win 'I Love Team Singapore' travel packages for
two to London, limited edition 'I Love Team Singapore' merchandise, and
other attractive prizes. The public will also be able to access the website
from QR codes that will be available at our partner outlets across Singapore.</p>
<p>4. The campaign aims to rally Singaporeans from all walks of life to show
that Team Singapore athletes are not alone in their pursuit for national
glory. This is in line with Vision 2030, which aims to forge stronger connections
between communities and our national athletes, and for Singaporeans to
develop a greater sense of national pride and identity. The campaign will
end on 10th September 2012.</p>
<p>5. "The Olympic and Paralympic Games are the biggest and most prestigious
sporting platforms that our athletes will be taking part in. They will
be facing stiff competition from the best athletes in the world. They will
need the strength and support of all Singaporeans in this high pressure
environment." said Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO of SSC. "The well-wishing campaign
is an opportunity for Singaporeans to show our athletes that they are not
alone and that we are united behind them the entire way. We are very lucky
to have dedicated partners, to help us reach out to all Singaporeans."</p>
<p>6. Living up to its long standing support of the Olympic Movement, McDonald's
has come onboard to help collect well-wishes for Team Singapore. The public
will be able to pen their words of encouragement for Team Singapore at
20 McDonald's outlets across the island.</p>
<p>7. "At McDonald's, we are proud to show our support for the inspirational
athletes of Team Singapore. We join with millions of other Singaporeans
in wishing them well." said Judy Harman, Managing Director, McDonald's
Restaurants.</p>
<p>8. NLB and ITE, the SSC's community outreach partners, are making a combined
effort to reach out to Singaporeans in the heartlands. The mural that was
unveiled at the launch today will be showcased at eight selected libraries
around Singapore: Jurong Regional Library, Woodlands Regional Library,
Ang Mo Kio Public Library, Queenstown Public Library, Central Public Library,
Sengkang Public Library, Cheng San Public Library and Clementi Public Library.</p>
<p>9. Mrs Elaine Ng, Chief Executive Officer of NLB said, "We are delighted
to be part of this effort to unify people, public and private sectors to
support Team Singapore. Singaporeans are welcome to spur on our athletes
by dropping their well-wishes into boxes at our libraries. They can also
enjoy the cheerful graffiti murals designed by ITE students at selected
libraries. We have a collection of more than 216,800 books and over 17,600
audio-visual materials on sports and related topics to fuel the interest
of our visitors."</p>
<p>10. Echoing Mrs Ng's sentiments, Mr Bruce Poh, Director and Chief Executive
Officer, ITE said, "ITE is pleased to partner SSC to support Team Singapore
for the London 2012. Besides creating the mural depicting seven athletes,
ITE students will be actively engaging the community by garnering well-wishes
from the members of public in eight public libraries throughout the campaign.
This will provide opportunities to build a greater sense of national identity
and help strengthen the community bonds among Singaporeans. In addition,
our students from the Community Sport and Recreation Management programme
can apply what they?ve learned in the classroom to a real world setting."</p>
<p>11. Venue partner Velocity will also be decorating its sports themed mall
with larger than life images of Team Singapore athletes. They will also
be hosting a meet and greet session with our nation's paddlers Feng Tianwei,
Wang Yuegu, Li Jiawei, Gao Ning, Yang Zi and Zhan Jian on 2 June 2012 from
2:30pm - 4:00pm.</p>
<p><strong>30 Days to Win Tickets to London</strong>
</p>
<p>12. The SSC is also giving away three 'I Love Team Singapore' travel packages
for two to London. To win the travel package, the public has 30 days to
submit their well-wishes for their favourite athletes. The contest will
close on 30th June 2012.</p>
<p>13. Two winners will be picked from the well-wishes collected from the
well-wishing boxes islandwide at McDonald's, NLBs, ITEs and Velocity; and
one winner will be chosen from the well-wishing mobile portal.</p>
<p>14. The 2012 Olympic Games will be held in London, from 27 July to 12
August 2012 and the 2012 Paralympic Games will take place between 29 August
and 9 September 2012.</p>
