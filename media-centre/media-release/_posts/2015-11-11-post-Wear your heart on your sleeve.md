### **Wear your heart on your sleeve**

The countdown to the 8th ASEAN Para Games has begun, and with less than a month to go, the Singapore ASEAN Para Games Organising Committee (SAPGOC) took one big step to ignite the APG fever, opened the “Official APG Merchandise store” in the heart of Orchard Road, this morning.

Located along the Orchard Pedestrian walkway, the pop-up store will feature a variety of limited edition APG merchandise including jerseys, dresses, hats, towels, gel bracelets, sports and country pins, as well as the Nila plush toy, a fan favourite during the 28th SEA Games which Singapore hosted earlier this year.

Mr Kerk Kim Por, Deputy Chairman, SAPGOC, emphasised the importance of having a store for the APG in the heart of Orchard Road. Mr Kerk said, “This year has been a monumental year for sport in Singapore, and after the success of the 28th SEA Games, we’re now less than a month to the first ever APG in Singapore. It’s about creating that visibility and awareness on para-sports, right in the heart of the shopping district. We hope that Singaporeans will take the chance to stop by the store and purchase a souvenir of the Games. Hopefully, they will be able to develop an appreciation for para sports as well.”

Besides encouraging the community to Back up APG and drumming up excitement in the lead up to the first ever APG in Singapore, the store also supports social good, with 10 percent of all revenue donated to social causes such as SportCares and Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) under the Care and Share Movement. The Care and Share Movement will match dollar for dollar eligible donations raised.
