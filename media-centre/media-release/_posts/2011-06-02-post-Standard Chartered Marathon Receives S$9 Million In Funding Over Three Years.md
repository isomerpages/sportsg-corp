### **Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore Receives S$9.75 Million In Funding Over Three Years**

_Standard Chartered Bank's Latest Injection is Largest-Ever Sponsorship for a Local Running Event_

**Singapore, 2 June 2011** - The sports community in Singapore will have more reasons to run, as Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) announced their continued support of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) with a S$9.75 million injection to the event and a three-year partnership with event organiser Singapore Sports Council (SSC) till 2013.

2. Guest-of-Honour Major General (NS) Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, was on hand to witness this landmark announcement, heralding the largest-ever corporate sponsorship for a running event in Singapore.

3. Commenting on the continued support of the SCMS, Mr Ray Ferguson, Regional Chief Executive Officer (Singapore and Southeast Asia) Standard Chartered Bank said, "After a very successful inaugural SCMS in 2010, we are delighted to announce our continued support for the event as title sponsor. The marathon has been a great platform for engaging all our stakeholders, and it resonates with what we stand for as an organisation - courage, a 'can-do' attitude, partnership, leading by example and the determination to 'go the distance'. We want to be involved in the growth of the race and help develop this marathon as Asia's pinnacle race together with our partner and event organiser, Singapore Sports Council."

4. Standard Chartered Bank's long-term commitment with marathons span over a decade, with the bank backing nine marathons globally, including the SCMS. The three-year sponsorship deal for the SCMS is one of the bank's largest and on-going sponsorships of a sports event in Singapore. The deal is a testament of the success and popularity of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore among Singaporeans.

5. CEO SSC Mr Lim Teck Yin, who is also the Chairman of the SCMS 2011 Organising Committee, thanked Standard Chartered Bank for their unwavering support of sports in Singapore. Apart from the SCMS, Standard Chartered Bank is also a long term supporter of Singapore Rugby, having contributed more than S$3 million since 1997 to support the growth of youth rugby in Singapore.

6. Said Mr Lim, "The SCMS is one of SSC's and Singapore's most successful and recognisable partnerships with a major corporation. The marathon is an excellent example of how sports can raise brand awareness, build market share and win customer loyalty for a corporate investor. SSC hopes to see more companies coming forward as our partners in sport."

7. The SSC will "continue to work hand-in-hand with Standard Chartered Bank and our partners" to create more successful SCMS editions over the years, said Mr Lim. "The inaugural Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2010 set the bar very high, but Singapore is known for its innovation and service excellence. We plan to have some new twists to make the event even more enjoyable for marathon fans from Singapore, the region and beyond. This is the People's Race."

8. The inaugural SCMS attracted a record 60,000 participants in 2010. Details of the SCMS 2011, including the routes, categories for participation are expected to be announced by race organiser SSC towards the end of June 2011.
