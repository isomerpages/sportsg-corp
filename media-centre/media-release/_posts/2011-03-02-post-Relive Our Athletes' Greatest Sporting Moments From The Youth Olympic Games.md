### **Relive Our Athletes' Greatest Sporting Moments From The Youth Olympic Games**

_SSC Commemorates Team Singapore Athletes' Achievements at YOG with Sports Photography Exhibition & Workshops_

**Singapore, 2 March 2011** - To relive the success stories and historic moments from Team Singapore's endeavour at the inaugural Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games (YOG), the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is proud to present the third edition of the Inspiring Sporting Singapore Photography Exhibition entitled "Reliving YOG Moments", an inspirational showcase featuring our nation's YOG medallists, and other young Team Singapore athletes in action during the games.

2. The exhibition will be held from 2 March 2011 to 2 May 2011 at 17 SSC Sports & Recreation Centres (SRCs) nationwide (see Annex A) and will showcase 34 colour images of Team Singapore athletes in competition at the YOG. Through this exhibition, the SSC aims to inspire Singaporeans to participate in sports.

3. "Every historic moment of the YOG undoubtedly lives on in the hearts and minds of every athlete who has participated in this inaugural competition, and what better way to pay tribute to the enduring spirit of our young Team Singapore athletes than to capture their once-in-a-lifetime experiences on camera," said Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, Singapore Sports Council, who has contributed three images from his own collection to the exhibition, including a close-up shot of YOG silver medallist Rainer Ng in the 50m backstroke swimming event.

4. "More importantly, these images will spark the interests and ignite the passions of Singaporeans to embrace a sporting culture through participation in sports," he added.

5. Providing support to the showcase as well is Mr Alex Chan, former Chairman of the SSC, who has contributed seven images to the exhibition. "Each of these images tells a story which reflects the true grit and determination displayed by our Team Singapore youth athletes in competition at the YOG. Through this collection, all Singaporeans can come together to relive the excitement and enthusiasm of the YOG," said Mr Chan.

6. In addition, photography enthusiasts who are keen to hone their skills in sports photography may do so by signing up for a series of sports photography workshops from 5 to 26 March 2011, conducted by renowned photographers from Reuters and Action Images, a division of Reuters Media. By inviting established sports photographers to conduct these workshops, the SSC hopes to inspire more people to transform their interest for photography into a viable career option. This will create a growing pool of local sports photographers which will fuel the vibrancy of our local sports industry.

7. The sports photography workshops feature experienced trainers such as Russell Boyce, Chief Photographer for Asia, Reuters; multi-award winning photographer Mindy Tan, and Jeremy Lee, Photographer and Sub-Editor, Action Images.

8. Besides having the opportunity to learn from the best trainers in the industry, photographers at the workshops will also get a chance put their skills to the test during a football match, with professional equipment sponsored by Nikon.

9. "I am delighted to share my experience and expertise on sports photography with the many talented photographers we have in our midst," said Mr Boyce.

10. 30 slots per sports photography workshop are available on a first-come-first-serve basis. Photographers who are interested in attending the complimentary workshops may register online at [www.sportsingapore.gov.sg](www.sportsingapore.gov.sg).

11. The Inspiring Sporting Singapore Photography Exhibition and sports photography workshops are part of the Let's Play movement, an initiative by the SSC to encourage all Singaporeans to embrace sports as a lifestyle choice, be it playing, watching, cheering or volunteering for sports.

**Annex D - Profiles of Sports Photography Workshop Trainers**

**Russell Boyce - Chief Photographer, Asia (Reuters)**
<br>
Having started out as a staff photographer in 1988, Russell has travelled the globe covering the most high profile news and sports events for Reuters UK. His assignments have included the Olympics, cricket, football and rugby World Cups and the Formula OneTM races. In addition to his illustrious career, Russell has also worked in war zones and covered international politics. In his 8 years tenure there, he progressed to become the Deputy Chief Photographer for UK and Ireland.

Based in Singapore, Russell is now the Chief Photographer for Asia. Besides running the daily picture file from Asia, Russell is often the lead editor at major sporting events such as the most recent 2010 FIFA Football World Cup in South Africa, looking at thousands of sports images every day. He believes that good editing is equally important as good photography and if either of these processes fails, the story will be lost.

Russell has a keen eye on the social media tracking trends and issues through Twitter (@Cropperboyce) and Facebook via the iPad. He also writes a weekly blog - "Asia - A Week in Pictures" which is posted every Monday on Reuters.com.

**Mindy Tan - Multi-award Winning Photographer**
<br>
Mindy is a multi-award winning photographer, having won at the International Photography Awards and the US-based Wedding Photojournalist Association. She started out as a journalist at The New Paper after winning the Singapore Press Holdings scholarship in 2004. Dedicated in bringing out the best of each story, her hard work was recognised as she won the Society of Publishers Asia (SOPA) award for excellence in Human Rights Reporting in 2007.

Mindy became a full-time professional photographer in 2008. Her uniqueness in interpreting pictures allows her to stand out from the crowd and she has been commissioned to take on numerous photography assignments around the region. She has also covered major sporting events such as the 2008 Beijing Paralympics, the inaugural Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games and the most recently, the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2010. Her works have been widely recognised within the industry and published in leading newspapers and magazines such as The Straits Times, Her World, Action Asia and also the cover of Nikon's Focus.

Last year, her passion in photojournalism paid off as Asia Exposed, a 30-minute TV documentary by Channel NewsAsia, featured her inspiring reportage photographs and her journey in photojournalism.

**Jeremy Lee - Photographer and Sub-Editor, Action Images**
<br>
Jeremy Lee started out as a commercial photographer in 2004 and has covered numerous high-end assignments for the likes of Levis, Sony, O2 and Subaru to name a few. He has also previously worked on a number of the Football Association of Singapore and the Singapore Rugby Union commercial assignments.

Tapping on his uncanny knack for perfect imagery, Jeremy ventured into the world of editorial news and sport in 2007 by joining Reuters News Agency, as Sub-Editor, working at the Global Pictures Desk, editing powerful and evocative images from around the globe.

In 2009, his love for sports and photography came to fruition as he moved to Action Images - a division of Reuters Media. Within this division, Jeremy was able to infuse his experience in commercial photography into editing high profile assignments for Action Images involving Wayne Rooney for Coca Cola UK and sport governing bodies such as FIFA on many of their global tournaments, ranging from beach soccer to 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Jeremy's most recent photography assignment was the Barclays Singapore Open 2010 - the most prestigious Asian tour golf tournament and the globally renowned Asian Soccerex Forum 2010 in Singapore.

Even though sport has become a popular vocation to many photographers in recent years, very few have the experience and expertise to interpret a brief with flair and originality. In 2010, Jeremy was instrumental in managing the photography assignments for SSC, notably the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. The objective is to capture the young Team Singapore athletes in action during the Games. This project created a large collection of inspiring images which was pivotal to the "Reliving YOG Moments" photography exhibition.
