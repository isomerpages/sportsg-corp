### **Launch of Sport On! Kids Club**

Keeping the FUN in Sports!

The Singapore Sports Council launched its first children's sports club, Sport On! Kids Club, at IMM, Level 3, Garden Plaza today. Sport On! Kids Club also pledged its support for the Team Singapore athletes at today's launch which inaugurated the well-wishing campaign for the Team at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Targeting children between the ages of 3 to 12 years old, the club aims to promote sports as an active and healthy lifestyle choice for children and their families.

Sport On! Kids Club aims at "Keeping the FUN in Sports!" for children and their parents. Rather than just competition, the fun factor is maintained in sports in the stimulating activities the club offers. Children can also get to learn about perseverance, fair play, cooperation and teamwork while enjoying sports with fellow members.

Offering a wide array of club activities such as sports workshops and sports camps, Sport On! Kids Club is a one-stop kids' sorting avenue for children and their parents in Singapore. The club also boosts accessible, after-school, weekend and holiday activities where members can look forward to an exciting line-up of upcoming Sport On! Kids Club events, beginning with the Kidz Walkz at East Coast Park on 28 June 2008, the Young Parents Fiesta from 27 to 29 June 2008, the Junior Olympic Adventure at National Library on 19 July 2008 and many more!

As part of the celebrations for the launch of Sport On! Kids Club, children whose birthdays fall on 8 June can sign up at the event to enjoy a special free membership for the first year. In addition, children whose birthdays fall in the month of June are entitled a 50% discount off the regular annual membership fee of $20. Benefits of the membership include participating sports workshops free-of-charge or at discounted rates, exclusive discounts from more than 90 sports providers like KinderGolf, Sports Silat Academy, The Swim Lab, Fico Sports Hub, Fuji Ice Palace, Ski360o, and many more!

"Sport On! Kids Club helps facilitate sporting opportunities for children, as young as 3 years old, as sports is not solely an activity for the adults or the athletically gifted. Sports can be a way of life for anyone, everyone. As we encourage Singaporeans of all ages to embrace and participate in sports, Sport On! Kids Club extends its wholesome and fun activities for the entire family too! This will foster and increase parent involvement in their child's sport participation," said Dr Bervyn Lee, Director, Sports Culture Division, Sports Marketing Group, Singapore Sports Council.

A website - www.sportonkids.com.sg has also been developed, to offer an integrated experience with its wide variety of sporting resources through linking up with various chatrooms, blogs, forums for children and their parents to share their views and information on sports-related matters.

Sport On! Kids Club was officially launched today, 8 June Sunday, at IMM, Level 3, Garden Plaza.
