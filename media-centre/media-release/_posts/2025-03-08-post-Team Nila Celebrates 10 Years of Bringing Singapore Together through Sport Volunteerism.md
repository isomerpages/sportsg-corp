<p><strong>Singapore, 8 March 2025 </strong>– More than 5,000 people comprising
volunteers, families, corporates, agency partners and the wider community
came together today for the inaugural Team Nila Carnival to mark 10 years
of sport volunteerism. The event celebrated Team Nila’s contributions,
with plans to further empower existing volunteers and encourage more people
to join the Team Nila community as part of the SG60 festivities.</p>
<p>The Team Nila Carnival was attended by Guest-of-Honour Mr Lawrence Wong,
Prime Minister (PM) and Minister for Finance; as well as special guests
Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge
of Trade Relations; and Mr Eric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (SPS),
Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (CCY) &amp; Ministry of Social
and Family Development. PM Wong, Minister Fu, and SPS Chua engaged with
the Team Nila volunteers at the event, expressing gratitude for their contributions
to Singapore’s sporting landscape over the past decade.</p>
<p>PM Wong was Minister (CCY) when Team Nila was launched in 2015 and contributed
to Singapore’s successful hosting of the Southeast Asian (SEA) and ASEAN
Para Games. Under Minister Fu’s stewardship as Minister (CCY) from 2015
to 2020, Team Nila continued to grow and make an impact, including supporting
the early COVID-19 battle in 2020. Today, Team Nila is a 50,000-strong
volunteer force, serving as a key pillar of Singapore’s sporting ecosystem.</p>
<p>Mr Alan Goh, CEO, Sport Singapore (SportSG), said, “Team Nila plays a
pivotal role in bringing Singaporeans together through sport volunteerism.
In the last 10 years, Team Nila has not only grown in numbers, but also
in its depth and breadth of support. Today, Team Nila is a dependable and
skilled volunteer force that leads and organises many events and programmes
for our sports fraternity. We look forward to celebrating 10 years of Team
Nila with the rest of Singapore in this very special SG60 year. We will
continue to create more growth opportunities for our long-time volunteers,
and welcome new volunteers with the many exciting initiatives in store
in 2025.”</p>
<p>Team Nila has been instrumental in promoting a culture of giving and social
cohesion through sport, providing support across five giving platforms
– ActiveSG Sport Centres, Sporting Events, Academies and Clubs, SportCares
and Active Health. Over the years, it has played a vital role by providing
SportSG with day-to-day support at various sport centres and Active Health
Labs, working with different segments of the community through programmes
such as Play Inclusive and Play-Ability, and supporting world-class sporting
events in Singapore such as the World Table Tennis Singapore Smash, Standard
Chartered Singapore Marathon, and HSBC SVNS Singapore. Those with expertise
in areas such as event photography, coaching and social media also give
their time to the many events, thus playing a valuable role in contributing
to the overall success of SportSG’s programmes and activities. Beyond the
area of sport, Team Nila volunteers have also contributed at a national
level and beyond, marching in the National Day Parade, putting together
care packs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and even packing and sorting donation
items for the victims of the 2023 earthquake in Turkey.</p>
<p>Some of these milestones and achievements were showcased in the Team Nila
Gallery Locker Display, the centrepiece of the Team Nila Carnival which
pays tribute to a decade of volunteer dedication. The exhibition featured
photos of Team Nila’s contributions, hard work and commitment over the
years, and details of significant milestones – including its presence at
key events, support of Team Singapore in local and overseas competitions,
and its service beyond the area of sport – that have transformed Team Nila
into the volunteer force for good that it is today.</p>
<p>The display also showcased Team Nila’s t-shirts from across the last 10
years, with a spotlight placed on the revitalised Team Nila uniform unveiled
in 2024. Featuring a lion emblem symbolising national pride, courage and
resilience, the uniform has become an identifiable symbol of Team Nila
at sporting events and programmes across Singapore. The uniform was signed
on-site at the carnival by PM Wong, Minister Fu and SPS Chua, before being
framed and displayed as the final touch to the exhibition.</p>
<p>Following its unveiling at the Team Nila Carnival, the exhibition will
be making its way around Singapore for the rest of 2025, allowing the wider
community to learn more about the impact that Team Nila has had on sport
and sport volunteerism in Singapore in the last decade.</p>
<p><strong><u>Team Nila Stepping Up in SG60 and Beyond</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As Singapore gears up for SG60 with an exciting sporting calendar, Team
Nila volunteers will continue to be at the forefront and play a key role
in fostering a sense of belonging and pride within our community. A 10,000-strong
volunteer force is estimated to contribute 250,000 hours towards supporting
these major events, namely the World Aquatics Championships 2025, World
Para Swimming Championships 2025, and the annual GetActive! Singapore National
Day celebration through sport.</p>
<p>Plans are afoot to empower Team Nila volunteers to contribute meaningfully
to SG60 initiatives and beyond. They include upcoming initiatives such
as Project Reignite – a monthly engagement effort to strengthen volunteer
engagement and encourage more to get involved, as well as expanded leadership
and training pathways to equip volunteers with the necessary skills and
experience.</p>
<p><strong><u>Other Highlights of Celebrations</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Team Nila Carnival was a vibrant celebration filled with interactive
zones, sport tryouts, fun-filled activities, and creative workshops designed
to bring the community together. It was also an opportunity for Team Nila
volunteers to enjoy the day along with friends and family – for them to
relish in the celebrations, specially put together as a show of appreciation
for their hard work.</p>
<p>Team Nila volunteers at the carnival also received their Team Nila friendship
bands, which were included as part of the event goodie bag. Created by
communities around Singapore, these unique, upcycled bands were made from
decommissioned Team Nila t-shirts, and are a symbol of the wider community’s
support and appreciation for Team Nila. Announced last December by SPS
Chua, this initiative saw SportSG staff, public agencies, corporate partners
and members of the public creating over 4,000 friendship bands for the
volunteers ahead of the carnival.</p>
