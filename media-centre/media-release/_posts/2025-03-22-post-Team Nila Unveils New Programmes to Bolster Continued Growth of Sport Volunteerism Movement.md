<p><strong>Singapore, 22 March 2025 –</strong> Team Nila, Singapore’s national
sport volunteer movement, unveiled new initiatives at its 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary
Dinner today, in a bid to further strengthen volunteer engagement and grow
the sport volunteerism movement in the years ahead. Guest-of-Honour, Mr
Eric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (SPS), Ministry of Culture, Community
and Youth &amp; Ministry of Social and Family Development attended the
event, where he also presented awards to volunteers for their outstanding
contributions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>New Programmes and Opportunities for Continued Growth</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new initiatives that were unveiled included: &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Little Team Nila Programme </strong>–
Aimed at fostering a love for sport and sport volunteerism from an early
age through sustained pathways. The programme will see children and youths
aged four and above cheering on Team Singapore athletes at key events and
competitions in Singapore and contributing to other key sporting events,
along with their schools and parents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Expanded partnerships </strong>–
Team Nila aims to forge mutually-beneficial partnerships with at least
100 organisations and schools across Singapore in 2025, in support of their
wider corporate social responsibility and student development goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>More</strong>  <strong>training for volunteers </strong>–
Team Nila aims to increase the number of volunteers trained from 1,000
in 2024 to 5,000 in 2025, as part of efforts to improve volunteers’ skillsets.
This is in conjunction with the various large-scale events that Singapore
will be playing host to this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Growing number of Team Nila Volunteer Leaders </strong>–
Double Team Nila’s leadership base to over 260 leaders by the end of 2025.
Team Nila is looking to increase this number to 1,000 by 2029, in time
for Singapore’s hosting of the 2029 Southeast Asian (SEA) and ASEAN Para
Games.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Two new categories for Team Nila Awards </strong>–
These awards seek to honour volunteer leaders who have shown dedication
in leading events such as Pesta Sukan, as well as corporates and schools
that actively support Team Nila. Both awards will debut in 2026, with more
information to be announced at a later date.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Team Nila 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Dinner: A Celebration of the Impact of Sport Volunteerism</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fifth edition of the Team Nila Awards was held in conjunction with
its 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary this year. A total of 421 awards across
three categories – 86 Gold, 103 Silver, and 232 Bronze<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> – were
presented in recognition of the volunteers’ exceptional commitment to Singapore’s
sporting ecosystem. This marked an increase from the 397 awards given out
in 2024, signifying greater commitment among more volunteers who have come
forward to give back through sport.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Tan Hock Leong, Chief, ActiveSG, Sport Singapore, shared, “As we celebrate
ten years of Team Nila bringing the community together through sport volunteerism,
we are excited to be introducing new initiatives that will further empower
our volunteers and enrich their experience with us. We look forward to
bringing more people onboard the movement, and co-creating a stronger and
more inclusive Singapore through sport as we head into an exciting SG60
year.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since it was established in 2015, Team Nila has grown into a network of
50,000 volunteers, contributing 1.5 million volunteer hours to support
world-class sporting events in Singapore and other national-level events,
including beyond the realm of sport. The Team Nila 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary
Dinner not only honours the service of the volunteers, but also acknowledges
the lasting impact they have made in fostering a culture of volunteerism
through sport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>More Volunteering Opportunities in SG60</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Team Nila can look forward to more opportunities to witness and contribute
to large-scale sporting events in 2025. A 10,000-strong volunteer force
is estimated to contribute 250,000 hours towards supporting SG60 events
- these include national-level celebrations such as the annual GetActive!
Singapore National Day celebration through sport, as well as international
events such as the World Aquatics Championships 2025 and World Para Swimming
Championships 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the opportunities available locally, over 100 Team Nila volunteers
will also be travelling to the 2025 SEA and ASEAN Para Games in Thailand,
where they will be instrumental in cheering on Team Singapore athletes.
The volunteers will also be able to gain insight into how Major Games are
organised and apply their learnings for the preparation and organisation
of the 2029 SEA and ASEAN Para Games, which will be hosted in Singapore.</p>
