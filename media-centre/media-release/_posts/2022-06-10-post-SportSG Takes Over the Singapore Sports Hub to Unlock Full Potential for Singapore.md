### **Sport Singapore takes over the Singapore Sports Hub to unlock full potential for Singapore**

Sport Singapore (SportSG) has initiated the termination of the Sports Hub Public-Private Partnership (“PPP”) project agreement and will take over the ownership and management of the Singapore Sports Hub. It has reached a mutual agreement with SportsHub Pte Ltd (SHPL) over the termination and the process of handover, and will officially take over the Sports Hub on 9 December 2022.

**New structure to support Singapore’s aspirations**

2. SHPL was engaged under the PPP in 2010 to design, build, finance and operate the Sports Hub. The PPP expires in 2035. The cost of this project was borne by SHPL, and SportSG has paid an annual fee from 2014, to finance and operate the Sports Hub. The terms of the project agreement allowed for SportSG to decide if and when the project should be terminated, and thereafter, for SportSG to take over the ownership and management of the Sports Hub.

3. The Sports Hub has been operating for eight years since its completion in 2014. The aspirations and needs of Singapore, as well as the wider operating environment for sports and entertainment, have changed considerably since then. Ownership and direct management of the Sports Hub will thus enable SportSG to have greater control and flexibility over the Sports Hub. With this move, SportSG will drive stronger social, sporting and economic outcomes through the Sports Hub, maximise its potential, and also take advantage of the synergies with the Kallang Alive precinct development.

**Greater access and activities for the community**

4. SportSG intends to make the Sports Hub more accessible to the broader community in Singapore, in terms of sports, lifestyle, entertainment and social uses, whilst maintaining its commercial sustainability. The Sports Hub should be a community icon for all to enjoy – from children and youth taking part in the National School Games, community competitions and grassroots events, junior and elite athletes training and competing, to everyday Singaporeans exercising and enjoying the facilities in and around the Sports Hub.

5. We will strengthen Singapore’s affinity with the Sports Hub through programmes, participation, and accessibility.

**Stronger integration with Kallang Alive**

6. In addition, with increasing regional competition from other world class venues on the horizon, there is a need to strengthen the Sports Hub’s position and coherence in the context of the larger Kallang Alive precinct. Taking ownership of the Sports Hub will enable closer integration of the Sports Hub with upcoming Kallang Alive facilities such as the Kallang Football Hub, Kallang Tennis Centre, and Youth Hub to deliver a more cohesive sporting and lifestyle precinct experience and more seamless event and programming offerings.

**Termination of Project Agreement**

7. The terms of the project agreement give SportSG the right to conclude the partnership and take ownership of the Sports Hub, at such time it sees fit. SportSG has decided for the termination to be effective on 9 December 2022.

8. There is no penalty for the termination, which can be done at any time SportSG chooses.

9. Upon termination, SportSG will pay SHPL a sum assessed in accordance with the Project Agreement that is substantially comprising:  
(i) The amount of the outstanding loan that was taken in respect of the construction of the Sports Hub. This is an expenditure that would have been incurred by SportSG had it financed the Sports Hub from the start, without the PPP; and  
(ii) A fair open market value of the Sports Hub.

10. The cost of terminating the PPP arrangement and taking over the operations of the Sports Hub is estimated to be comparable to the cost of continuing with the PPP arrangement until 2035.

**Next steps**

11. Both SportSG and SHPL are committed to working closely together to ensure that the handover will be smooth and will not affect the day-to-day operations and programming of the Sports Hub.

12. SportSG will continue to work with partners from the private sector to deliver the highest quality service for the Sports Hub.

13. SportSG, with SHPL, will engage SHPL employees individually to discuss employment opportunities. We intend to retain the expertise and experience of SHPL employees, who will be given the opportunity to transit to the new corporate entity.

14. Chairman of SportSG Kon Yin Tong said, “We have a longer-term vision for the Sports Hub and the wider Kallang area, through which we can achieve our national sporting, social and economic aspirations. Taking back ownership and management of the Sports Hub will enable us to turn it into the heart of sports in Singapore and ride on synergies to develop the Kallang Alive precinct. I believe that the new entity will deliver greater community access and vibrancy in sports, entertainment, lifestyle and major event offerings to Singaporeans. I would like to thank the team at SHPL for their contribution of expertise in the design and construction of the Sports Hub, and for their role in this project since its opening in 2014. We look forward to building on these foundations to expand the impact and value of the Sports Hub and the broader Kallang Alive precinct for all of Singapore.”

15. Chairman of SHPL Bryn Jones said, “It has been an honour to play a role in the rich history of the iconic National Stadium and to build the Singapore Sports Hub ecosystem into the region’s premier sports, entertainment, and lifestyle destination. We have delighted in the moments and experiences shared with Singaporeans who have come to Sports Hub to play, compete, participate, and spectate over the years, and we thank them, together with our wonderful staff, partners and sponsors, who have made it all possible. We support the Government’s ambitions in promoting sport among the population and harnessing Sports Hub’s potential to transform the Kallang Alive precinct and we will work collaboratively and constructively to ensure a smooth transition over the next six months. We wish Sport Singapore all the best as they take the project and the vibrant calendar of events forward to realise the Nation’s aspirations.”
