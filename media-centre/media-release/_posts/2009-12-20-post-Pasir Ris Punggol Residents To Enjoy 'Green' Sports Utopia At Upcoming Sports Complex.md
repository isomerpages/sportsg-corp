### **Pasir Ris-Punggol Residents To Enjoy 'Green' Sports Utopia At Upcoming Sports Complex**

Pasir Ris West Sports Carnival Held in Conjunction with Ground Breaking Ceremony of the Pasir Ris Sports Complex
Singapore, 20 December 2009 - This morning marked a momentous occasion for Pasir Ris West residents as they joined their Member of Parliament (MP) Mr Teo Chee Hean, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, at the ground breaking ceremony for the new Pasir Ris Sports Complex. This was followed by the Pasir Ris West Sports Carnival, in which residents tried their hand at various sports stations such as basketball, bowling and table tennis. Also present at the event were other Pasir Ris-Punggol MPs, as well as the Singapore Sports Council's (SSC) senior management.

2. When completed in mid-2011, the Pasir Ris Sports Complex which will be located at the junction of Pasir Ris Drive 3 and Pasir Ris Central, will offer guests a unique sporting experience right in the town centre, and yet with a park setting. "Sports is a powerful way to further strengthen the bonds within families and among friends and ultimately, create a robust nation," said Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence. "I envision the Pasir Ris Sports Complex to be a means towards not only better physical health for each resident, but also for the strong social health of the community."

3. With the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games taking place next August, sports is now at the forefront on the country's agenda. It is important for the community to get behind Singapore as a sporting nation and to achieve this: by providing the right facilities for the residents. The new Pasir Ris Sports Complex is another step forward in this sporting direction. Spanning over 1.4 hectares, the complex will offer well-equipped and modern amenities to encourage families to utilise and enjoy sporting fun together, as well as develop a healthy lifestyle.

4. In addition, with environmental sustainability being crucial in today's society, the Pasir Ris Sports Complex is specially designed to give guests the feeling of being in a 'green' sporting sanctuary right in the middle of the town centre. Commenting on this, Mr Alex Chan, Chairman of the SSC, said, "The Pasir Ris Sports Complex will be another shining example of the consumer-driven philosophy underpinning the development of the new Singapore Sports Council's Sports and Recreation Centres. It will offer residents a unique sporting experience with a strong lifestyle twist, including a diverse retail mix of shops along with 'green' and sustainable features."

5. Added Mr Chan, "The 'green' element of the Pasir Ris Sports Complex which will include built-in, heat reduction features such as vertical green walls, sun-shading devices and landscaping will make for a comfortable and cool environment for residents to exercise or enjoy family outings."

6. Other 'green' and sustainable features of the Pasir Ris Sports Complex are:
Landscaping to beautify the exterior as well as to reduce ambient heat gain;
Rainwater harvesting system to irrigate the plants; and
Exploratory use of energy recycling such as through the use of photo-voltic light fittings.

7. The Pasir Ris Sports Complex will also offer amenities such as a swimming complex, a 2,000-seat sports hall, a gymnasium, a dance studio, foyer space for events, as well as retail and F&B outlets. It will serve as a key community gathering point for Pasir Ris West.

8. Once completed, the Pasir Ris Sports Complex will be the SSC's 22nd Sports and Recreation Centre - all providing affordable and accessible facilities for Singaporeans to play as well as bond through sports with their friends and families.
