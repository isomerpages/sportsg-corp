### **Sports Sponsorship Master Class to enhance the local sports scene**
Sport Singapore and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) have come together to support a series of sport-focused sponsorship master classes for the National Sports Associations (NSAs) and brands who want to tap onto the local sports industry. This is the second series of the sponsorship master classes that the two agencies have supported after the successful pilot run of ‘Seeking Sponsorship’ in November 2014.  
  
2015 had been an exciting period for the local sports industry with the 28th SEA Games and 8th ASEAN Para Games. Organisers of both Games had been heartened to see corporates come forward to support local sports and athletes. The 28th SEA Games and 8th ASEAN Para Games had surpassed their targets by garnering over S$80 million and S$12 million in cash and value-in-kind, respectively.  
  
Leveraging on the bustling year for local sports in 2015, this second series of master classes aims to keep the momentum going for sports sponsorship.  
  
To date, 74 participants have attended the Sports Master Class Series on the thematic ‘Sponsorship’. The attendees were from 47 organisations, of which 34 were small- and medium-sized enterprises, including NSAs.  
  
This includes a basic level “Seeking Sponsorship” master class and/or an advance “Sponsorship War Room” master class, culminating in a “The ASA Exchange” session. The ASA Exchange simulates real-life scenarios, the NSAs pitched themselves to companies in a “Speed Dating” session. The “sellers”, or NSAs, would put forward compelling reasons on how companies can gain from their involvement through the NSAs’ event or sport. The “buyers”, or companies, would then assess these pitches, and hopefully see value of sports marketing, importance of sponsorship activation and how sport can translate into benefit for the company’s brand name. (Details of each class in Annex A)  
  
The intention of having these master classes is for participants to learn how to seek out sponsors, measure sponsorships effectively, understand the importance of working closely with companies to mutually benefit both the brands and NSAs, and build better events.  
  
A master class entitled, “Creating a Sponsorship Strategy” was also conducted to get brands aware on the current sporting landscape, and how they can leverage on such events to create exposure for their organisation.  
  
Country Garden is one such participant. The property development company, which has not traditionally participated in sport sponsorship, shared more on the reasons why they are looking to tap onto this industry.  
  
Mr Jack Liew, Director of Sales & Marketing of Country Garden shares more. “This sports sponsorship master class has been helpful, and has given us a better picture for us to initiate our positioning and branding. We are interested in sponsoring some events in the Singapore sports industry, to encourage everyone to have a healthier life and at the same time, build up awareness of our corporate branding in Singapore.”  
  
Through these initiatives, SportSG and WDA hope to build a strong Singapore core of sports professionals with deepened skills and knowledge on sport sponsorship.  
  
Chief of Strategic Development and Marketing Group, Sport Singapore, Mr Toh Boon Yi is optimistic of programmes such as these. “Our plan is to encourage the growth of the sports industry through the commercial route. We hope to put NSAs and sport event organisers in touch with brands to discuss how both parties can mutually benefit from working together. We are glad that WDA has expressed strong support for this Sport Sponsorship Master Class. We hope that Corporate Singapore will continue to step forward to participate and value-add to the sports industry in creative and innovative ways.”  
  
Director, Tourism Division, WDA, Ms Janice Foo added, “This series of Master Classes on Sports Sponsorship will provide participants with the necessary knowledge and expertise on managing sponsorships through post consultancy sessions with companies, field study learning trips to events and networking sessions between brands and right holders. These will equip national sports associations and companies with skills and knowledge on Sports Sponsorship and enable them to better engage companies for sponsorships for their sport.”  
  
SportSG will continue to work with WDA to support Master Classes on identified themes based on the skills gaps of the sport industry.  
  
Since the last series of the Sports Sponsorship Master class, there has been a demand to learn more on such strategies. Mohamed Hafidz, Director of Marketing & Communications in Singapore Swimming Association (SSA), who attended the last series said that the learnings from the class was evident.  
  
“Previously, we used to work with sponsors on an event to event basis. However, over the last 2 years and based on the learnings from the class, we have managed to develop long term sponsorships, which are beneficial for both SSA and the sponsors. ”
