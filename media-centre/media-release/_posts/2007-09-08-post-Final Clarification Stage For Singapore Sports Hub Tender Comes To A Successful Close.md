### **Final Clarification Stage for Singapore Sports Hub tender comes to a successful close**

The Singapore Government announced the successful close of the Final Clarification Stage (FCS) for the Singapore Sports Hub Invitation to Tender (ITT) today at 4 pm.

FCS submissions were delivered to the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) by the following consortiums:

* Alpine Mayreder Consortium
* Singapore Sports Hub Consortium
* Singapore Gold Consortium

The Final Clarification Stage is an optional provision in the ITT procurement process that allows the SSC to incorporate final additional requirements and get responses that address "areas of improvement" identified from the initial ITT submissions. The FCS for the Sports Hub required the consortiums to incorporate a Water Sports Centre into their proposals.

With the Water Sports Centre, the flexibility and uniqueness of the Sports Hub development is even further enhanced, as it will be the world's first fully integrated facility comprising track and field, indoor games, aquatic sports, and water sports; together with leisure and entertainment activities.

"We are very happy to confirm that we have received the FCS submissions from the three consortiums for the Sports Hub project. With the completion of the FCS, the Sports Hub tender will now enter the final stage of evaluation before the successful consortium is appointed." said Oon Jin Teik, CEO of the Singapore Sports Council.

The successful consortium is expected to be appointed by end January 2008. Bids will be evaluated on four criteria:

1. Appeal of sports, leisure and entertainment programming (40%)
2. Functionality and quality design (25%)
3. Financial and legal appeal (25%)
4. Facilities management (10%)
