### **Deloitte, SIM Global Education and University of Stirling Support Athletes’ Meaningful and Holistic Development**

The Singapore Sports Institute (SSI), National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI), Deloitte Singapore, SIM Global Education and University of Stirling today came together in the spirit of helping local athletes strive for success both in sport and life. To this end, two new initiatives were launched – a “Sponsorship for Athletes” book funded by Deloitte, and SIM Global Education/University of Stirling Sports Scholarships for two local athletes to pursue a Sports Studies & Marketing degree.  
  
These two initiatives mark the first formal collaboration between SSI and NYSI since the latter was launched in November 2015, signalling both parties’ continued dedication to complement each other’s efforts in looking into the holistic development local athletes. Said SSI’s Chief, Bob Gambardella: “While SSI and NYSI have been working in synergy for quite some time now, the two initiatives that we are launching today represent our commitment in helping our athletes achieve excellence in both sport and life.”  
  
SSI, which is under the ambit of Sport Singapore, has been also very persistent in its effort to galvanise Corporate Singapore’s support for athletes. Over the years, initiatives like spexBusiness Network have given the athletes robust support from the private sector. The two initiatives introduced today further cements the contribution and support of Corporate Singapore to the athletes. “The contributions from Deloitte Singapore, SIM Global Education and University of Stirling are a testament that businesses believe in the power of sport and value of supporting our local athletes. We hope to welcome more members of Corporate Singapore on board in supporting our athletes’ ambitions,” Gambardella said.  
  
**Helping athletes engage in meaningful sponsorships**  
  
Some 400 copies of the “Sponsorship for Athletes” have been produced, aimed at educating local athletes at all levels on how to engage in valuable and sustainable sponsorships. Written by Vickie Saunders, one of Australia’s most recognised thought leaders on athlete sponsorship, the book is an adaptation of an earlier edition that has inspired and empowered hundreds of Australian athletes. The Singapore edition has been customised to suit the local context, and highlights the experiences of home-grown athletes like Calvin Kang, Dipna Lim Prasad, Koh Sock Hwee, Tao Li, Remy Ong, and Theresa Goh in seeking and securing sponsorships. Quotes on how other athletes like Derek Wong, Micky Lin and Rachel Yang, also Deloitte employees, have benefitted from sponsorships are also featured in the book.  
  
Said Saunders, who is passionate about athlete sponsorship and identifying opportunities: “Athletes have the power to inspire people, and it is not just because of the medals they win and records they break. They get up early in the morning to train while the rest of us sleep, sacrifice social engagements to stick to a demanding training plan, and overcome adversity and setbacks only to come out fighting to achieve their goals. Their discipline, commitment, hard work, passion, and teamwork are personal attributes and actions that make athletes so valuable to sponsors. I hope to help them recognise and harness their true value and engage in mutually valuable and meaningful sponsorship.”  
  
Said James Walton, Clients & Markets Principal, Deloitte Singapore and also leader of the Deloitte Ignite programme: “To us, sponsorship of sports and athletes is not just about branding and publicity; it helps to inspire and fulfil dreams, and the rewards are more than the monetary. Through Deloitte Ignite, we support athletes through scholarship, internship and employment opportunities, and this gives us access to top talent that possess attributes we value in our people such as ambition, drive, focus and high performance. Having athletes also adds to our employee diversity and allows our people to interact and share different skills, mindsets and experience. For the athletes, these opportunities allow them to make use of the skills and qualities acquired from sports in a world outside of it, giving them the stability in the present to balance sports and work without compromising on the passion, dedication and energy that each requires, and the experience that prepares them for a future after sports where they can contribute to society in other ways.”  
  
Said Team Singapore sprinter Calvin Kang: “I had an early start in sponsorship, featuring in a Milo campaign at 15. From there I made myself available for any engagements and built an ongoing relationship with sponsors. Beyond my contribution to this book, I look forward to sharing my experience with fellow athletes to help them better engage in sponsorships. I see this as a way of giving back to my sport, to the sporting fraternity, and to Singapore.”  
  
**More opportunities for athletes to pursue further education**  
  
SIM Global Education and University of Stirling announced today that they will be jointly offering two bond-free scholarships to local athletes who are interested in a future career in the sports industry. The Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Sports Studies & Marketing degree will be conferred by the University of Stirling, Scotland’s University of Sporting Excellence, and one of SIM Global Education’s partner universities.  
  
Said Ms Ho Soon Eng, Director for Higher Education, SIM Global Education: “This scholarship is in addition to other scholarships that SIM Global Education has been offering to students with exemplary academic results or achievements in arts and sports. Investing in scholarships is in line with SIM’s social mission and holistic education philosophy.  
  
Local athletes will be able to train and compete and at the same time pursue their degree aspirations by taking advantage of the flexible and modular nature of the Stirling programme offered locally through SIM Global Education.”
