### **SSC To Offer Wider Range Of Sports Medicine And Sports Science Support For Team Singapore At London 2012**

**Singapore, 4 August 2011** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has started to ramp up preparations as the clock counts down to the London 2012 Olympics in less than a year. Kicking off the preparations, the SSC has signed an agreement with the University of East London (UEL) to base the Team Singapore recovery centre at its Stratford Campus - where SSC will offer a wider range of sports medicine and sports science support for Team Singapore athletes compared to any other Olympic Games in the past.

2. Occupying a space of about 270 square metres on the premises of the temporary teaching building, a short five minute drive away from the Athlete's Village, this Team Singapore recovery centre is about three times bigger than that of the Beijing Olympics. The additional space allows for a wider range of recovery services to be available to the athletes, to include nutrition and physiology, which were not offered at the last Olympics.

3. Based there will be a team of eight sports medicine and sports science staff comprising a medical officer, psychologist, nutritionist, physiologist and four physiotherapists and masseurs. The team will move into the premises on 20 July 2012 to begin preparations and set up operations before the athletes arrive and the Games begin on 27 July 2012. Following Team USA, Team Singapore is second to secure a space at UEL to base its onsite operations for the upcoming London 2012 Olympic Games.

4. "London 2012 is an important Olympic Games for Team Singapore and the SSC must ensure that our athletes are given the best and most comprehensive sports medicine and sports science support. The Team Singapore recovery centre plays a critical role in our athletes' performance as it will keep them in optimal condition to compete. Finding a good location, coupled with a comprehensive suite of services were key priorities for us as we were deciding on the support we would give to our athletes," said Bob Gambardella, Chief of Sports Development Group and Singapore Sports Institute, SSC.

5. "The proximity of the recovery centre to the Athletes' Village and great facilities were deciding factors as to why we chose UEL as the location for the Team Singapore recovery centre. Being so close to the Village will allow our athletes to make an easy and seamless transition to the recovery centre," added Bob who was present at the signing ceremony at UEL.

6. UEL Pro Vice-Chancellor, Selena Bolingbroke, welcomed the deal saying, "UEL are delighted to host Team Singapore during the London 2012 Games and add to our growing number of Olympic partners who will operate from our campuses next year. The partnership is also an opportunity to build the legacy that will continue beyond 2012 and into the future to boost participation in sport and meet UEL's aim of being the best university in London for sport by 2015."

**Acclimatisation Training for Singapore's Olympic Hopefuls**

7. Team Singapore's Olympic Hopefuls are now currently in Surrey Sports Park for acclimatisation training camp. 30 athletes and 10 officials from three sports will be there - badminton (31 July - 7 August), shooting (26 July - 7 August) and table tennis (30 July - 15 August).

8. Commenting on the athletes' July/August 2011 acclimatisation training camp, Bob said, "Apart from training, the athletes will also be touring London to take in tourist sights such as Buckingham Palace, the Big Ben and the London Eye. We are doing this so that the athletes are able to fully concentrate on the competition when they arrive in London next year."

9. This year's camp is one part of a two acclimatisation training stints at the Surrey Sports Park that our athletes will be taking part in. They will be there again next year just before the Olympic Games for 10 days, from 14 to 24 July 2012.
