### **SportCares Youth Celebrate Volunteerism on Global Youth Service Day**

In conjunction with Global Youth Service Day 2016, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, Ms Grace Fu, joined some 20 youth from SportCares Foundation (SportCares) and Youth Corps Singapore this morning to help prepare and pack hot meals at the Willing Hearts Soup Kitchen. These meals will be distributed to beneficiaries of Willing Hearts that include the elderly, the disabled and low-income families.  
  
At the event, Minister reiterated the importance of volunteerism and how it enables a stronger and cohesive society.  
  
“Anyone can volunteer, no matter your age. Our youth from SportCares and Youth Corps Singapore show how easy it can be. I hope more Singaporeans, especially our youth will embrace volunteerism and develop a stronger sense of responsibility for our fellow citizens. When we care, we make a difference, not just for the beneficiary, but for the giver. That’s how we grow as individuals, and grow closer to the ones we serve. That’s how we can grow as a caring and cohesive community,” said Minister Fu.  
  
Global Youth Service Day is an annual celebration of young volunteers around the world. It encourages youth to participate in community service and service-learning and honours those who have contributed to their communities through voluntary commitment.  
  
Chief Executive Officer of Sport Singapore, Mr Lim Teck Yin said, “For the past three years, SportCares has been seeding the roots of a national movement where people from different parts of the community use sport for social good. Through the prosocial sports programme they run with community partners, SportCares encourages social inclusion, personal empowerment and community bridging. It is inspiring to see our youth coming together to do good for society.”

The SportCares youth who volunteered at the event found it a particularly meaningful experience, especially since they come from vulnerable backgrounds. Through giving back to the community, this volunteering experience has enabled the SportCares youth to pick up new skills, expand their social circles and gain a sense of confidence.  
  
Says 17-year old SportCares youth, Wayne Tang, “I’ve always wanted to go out and make some good things happen. I am proud to be a youth volunteer with SportCares, as I know my action will help make a difference in other people’s lives. Also, volunteering has taught me valuable skills such as managing events, thinking on my feet and solving problems creatively.”  
  
Following the service-learning activity at Willing Hearts, the 20 SportCares youth joined 30 of their team mates at the Singapore Sports Hub, where they led 50 Willing Hearts beneficiaries in community sport games such as speedminton and lawn bowling.  
  
Using sport as a force for social good, SportCares encourages youth under their programmes to contribute back to the community by becoming a volunteer. SportCares also provide opportunities for youth in general to be a volunteer at sports events. In 2015, SportCares partnered ITE College West to run The Nila Suite, a hospitality lounge for athletes at the 28th SEA Games and 8th ASEAN Para Games.
