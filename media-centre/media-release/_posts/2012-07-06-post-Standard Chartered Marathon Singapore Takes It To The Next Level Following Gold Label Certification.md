### **Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore Takes It To The Next Level Following Gold Label Certification**

**Singapore, 6 July 2012** - Singapore's premier running event, the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS), is set to live up to its status as an International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) Gold Label race by delivering an enhanced race experience for all.

2. Leading the way is Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer of the SSC and Chairman of the marathon organising committee. He said, "Running is the most popular sport in Singapore and the SCMS is the only Gold Label certified running event locally to date. We believe the sweet spot for a good quality marathon in Singapore's context is in the range of 60,000 runners. This will allow us to pay more attention to the race experience, which is not only about running along a scenic route, but also about the ambience along the running route and other programmes we organise around the marathon in the lead up to and during race day."

3. "As the race takes place every December, we want to leverage on this by injecting some festive elements to lift the overall atmosphere of the race, as well as to create a fun and unique experience for our runners. These characteristics will be distinct to the SCMS and will definitely contribute to the overall festive cheer in Singapore," added Lim.

4. Other improvements to the Marathon include revised race routes, faster processing times at baggage deposit counters and more slots for pre-race runner's activities. Pre-race runner's activities include running clinics and sponsor programmes for SCMS participants in preparation for race day. Registration fees for this year's race also remain unchanged.

5. In line with this year's theme of Run for a Reason, the Run for good charity programme featuring Give.sg will also be back to provide a platform where SCMS participants can raise money for their preferred social causes.

6. Mr Ray Ferguson, Chief Executive Officer, Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore, said, "For the last 10 years, Standard Chartered Bank is proud to have played a part in nurturing Singapore's passion for running. The passion, courage, and determination of the runners each year resonate strongly with what we stand for as an organisation. Just as the runners are determined to finish the race, we are committed in our partnership with the SSC to deliver a quality race for all, this year and beyond. This is very much part of our DNA and what we set out in our brand promise to be Here for good in the communities where we operate."

7. The Event Launch was graced by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports. He was joined by Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, SSC; Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, SSC; and Mr Ray Ferguson, Chief Executive Officer, Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore. Together they flagged off the launch of SCMS 2012.

8.  The SCMS attained the IAAF Gold Label certification following last year's race, putting it among other prestigious races such as the London, Berlin and New York City marathons. Singapore is only the fifth Asian country and the first in South-East Asia to achieve this, affirming its reputation as one of the finer races in the world. It is also one of three Standard Chartered Marathons to attain the Gold Label certification.

9. The first 1,000 registrants at Raffles Place Park received a limited edition SCMS goodie bag each, and stood a chance to win attractive prizes from the race's sponsors, such as a Seiko watch worth S$645 and Pure Fitness memberships worth up to S$2,500.

10. Runners can also register online via the official website (www.marathonsingapore.com) from 11am on 6 July 2012, and at Toa Payoh Sports & Recreation Centre (SRC) from 10am on 7 July 2012 onwards. More information is available on SCMS' official website.
