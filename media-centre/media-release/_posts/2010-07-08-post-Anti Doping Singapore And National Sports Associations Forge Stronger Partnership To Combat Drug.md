### **Anti-Doping Singapore And National Sports Associations Forge Stronger Partnership To Combat Drug Use In Sport**

**Singapore, 8 July 2010** - As part of Anti-Doping Singapore's (ADS) efforts to combat the use of drugs in sport, it has engaged the National Sports Associations (NSAs) in an Anti-Doping Policy briefing session on 8 July 2010 at the Singapore Management University Ngee Ann Kongsi Auditorium.

The briefing was held to shed more light on the detailed protocols and procedures for ADS' functions that are contained in the policy to help the NSAs successfully implement the anti-doping rules that were developed in consultation with key sporting organisations and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

Formed on 15 March 2010, the ADS will take over Singapore National Olympic Council's Anti-Doping in Sports Commission (SADSC) in overseeing anti-doping matters in Singapore. The purpose of having a separate anti-doping entity is a demonstration of the Singapore Government's commitment to the fight against doping in sport, when they ratified the UNESCO Convention Against Doping in Sport in 2007.

Commenting on the significance of the anti-doping body, ADS Chairman, Dr Patrick Goh said, "It is important for all stakeholders to take a zero tolerance approach to doping in sport. Sport is about integrity and fairness. The use of performance-enhancing drugs tilts that playing field. ADS will play a crucial role in achieving the highest levels of integrity and sporting conduct that is necessary for sports organisations to work together, nationally and internationally."

Dr Goh said, "ADS' policies and practices are built on international standards and best practices in tackling the scourge of doping in sport, while ensuring alleged offenders receive a fair hearing. ADS will adopt a tough stance against doping while upholding and respecting the rights of athletes, and at the same time seeking to inform and educate them."

ADS is working closely with the Singapore Sports Council to include anti-doping information within the Coaching Syllabus, as well as the Ministry of Education's Co-Curricular Activities Branch to conduct educational outreach initiatives targeted at athletes competing at the national schools' level.

Singapore's elite athletes and the NSA support personnel can also look forward to workshops that focus on areas such as:
a. Athlete/ Support Personnel Rights and Responsibilities and Consequences of Doping
b. Doping Control Procedures
c. Prohibited List and Therapeutic Use Exemption Procedure
d. Athlete Whereabouts Information and the use of the Anti-Doping Administration & Management System

"I am very pleased that Singapore has taken the important steps of establishing an independent anti-doping body. Singapore's involvement and leadership within the Southeast Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organisation along with the support of the Singapore Government and the Singapore Sports Council were important factors that lead to the establishment of ADS," said the World Anti-Doping Agency Director General," David Howman.

"It is an important year for Singapore with the forthcoming Youth Olympic Games approaching. The establishment of the ADS displays Singapore's global efforts to ensure clean sport and effective education of youth," said Mr Howman.

NSAs and athletes agree that the creation of ADS represents a comprehensive response to Singapore's obligations under the WADA Code.

Mr Low Teo Ping, President of Singapore Rugby Union and Vice-President of SNOC said, "The setting up of ADS is timely as participation by our Singapore athletes grows exponentially both at the local, regional and international levels. Our athletes must understand that winning must not be at all cost, definitely not with stimulants or drugs but from hard work and self belief. Athletes representing Singapore are also ambassadors at home and abroad and ADS can also support them to influence others from falling into the drug trap. My best wishes to ADS to promote a dope free sporting environment in Singapore."

Rainer Ng, an up and coming swimmer echoed this sentiment, "Athletes and athlete support personnel will become more aware of their roles and responsibilities about anti-doping. ADS will help to create a generation of sports people who understand the value of competing drug-free. Through an array of programmes and initiatives, I hope that ADS will deliver, inform and promote the principles of doping-free sport in Singapore."
