### **Organisers Advise On Road Closures During The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2010**

**Singapore, 1 December 2010** - The highly anticipated, inaugural Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2010 is taking place on Sunday, 5 December 2010 with a record number of 60,000 runners. With three different routes marked out for the race, the Singapore Sports Council, the organiser of the Marathon, would like to advise the public on the road closures and traffic diversions expected on race day.

The organiser has made every effort to minimise and mitigate disruption to road traffic with earlier start times across all race categories. Traffic diversions will also be done in stages, with traffic flow fully restored in all areas progressively.

With the Full Marathon starting at Orchard Road at 5am, the Half Marathon at Sentosa at 6.30am, and the 10km at the Esplanade Bridge at 7.45am, members of the public are advised to plan alternative routes to get to the affected areas.

Key areas closed to the public include:
<br>Marina Bay Area
<br>Sentosa and Telok Blangah Area
<br>Chinatown Area
<br>Mountbatten and East Coast Area
<br>Orchard Area
<br>City and Suntec Area

More information on the road closures and diversions can be found at www.marathonsingapore.com.

Alternatively, the public can also contact the organisers at 6319 2630 during office hours, as well as at the same number from 9am to 6pm on Race Day, or e-mail info@marathonsingapore.com should they require additional information.
