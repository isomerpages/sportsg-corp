<h3><strong>SportSG updates Sport Resilience Package for businesses and SEPs</strong></h3>
<p>The recent tightening of measures under the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)
has significantly impacted the sport and fitness industry. Sports and fitness
are important to our health and well-being and the Government is committed
to supporting the sector through this period.</p>
<p><strong>New Broad-based Measures</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SportSG has worked closely with MOF on broad-based measures to safeguard
livelihoods in the sport and fitness industry and defray operating costs
during this period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible businesses in the sports and fitness industry will receive 50%
Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) support from 16 May onwards. These eligible businesses
are gyms, fitness studios and other sport facilities that are classified
under SSIC 93111, 93119, 93120 or 85410; and operate sports- and/or fitness-related
programmes that are (i) conducted indoors without masks on prior to P2(HA);
or (ii) for those 18 years and under prior to P2(HA).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eligible sports and fitness businesses will also benefit from rental relief.
For Government-owned commercial properties, the Government will grant one
month of rental relief for qualifying tenants. For privately-owned commercial
properties, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will disburse
a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout directly to qualifying tenants as
part of the new Rental Support Scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-employed persons in the sport and fitness sector who have experienced
an income loss of at least 50% for at least one month, from 8 May to 30
June 2021, may apply for the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) scheme.
Eligible individuals may receive a one-off payout of up to $500. The Ministry
of Social and Family Development will release more details shortly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Updates to Sport Resilience Package Measures</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>With the introduction of the above broad-based measures, there are updates
to the $18M Sport Resilience Package measures announced on 11 May.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sport and Fitness Operating Grant: The grant will provide additional support
for more than 500 gyms and fitness studios. Eligible entities will receive
a one-time disbursement ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 to defray operating
costs, subject to prevailing criteria and eligibility for other available
support measures. 400 applications have been received so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following MOF’s announcement that eligible sport and fitness entities
will be supported by the enhanced JSS and rental relief scheme from 16
May onwards, the Sport and Fitness Operating Grant amounts will be adjusted
accordingly to cover a shorter period of 8 May – 15 May 2021. SportSG will
be contacting those who had earlier applied for the Sport and Fitness Operating
Grant on the outcome of their applications. Applications will close on
4 June 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sport and Fitness SEP Support Fund: We earlier announced the sport and
fitness SEP support fund where eligible applicants will receive a one-time
payment of up to $400.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following MOF’s announcement, the Sport and Fitness SEP Support Fund will
be subsumed under the new COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) scheme. We
encourage sport and fitness SEPs to submit their applications for the COVID-19
Recovery Grant (Temporary) scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SEP Project Grant:</strong> This grant is open to self-employed
fitness professionals, freelance coaches and instructors. The first round
of applications was conducted on 17 May 2021 in a hackathon format, a sprint-like
event for participants to ideate and create innovative content together.
SportSG provided guidance as participants formulated their proposals. Close
to 40 projects comprising individual or group participants have been awarded
with about $315,000 to date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second round of applications was launched from 20 to 26 May with more
than 200 applications received. SportSG will be organising a briefing and
training session to assist applicants who are new to producing digital
content. Details on the next application window will be released in due
course.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Updates to Existing Measures under Sport Resilience Package</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuing Coach Education (CCE) Training Allowance Grant:</strong> Training
grants have been extended to include fitness instructors to actively engage
in continuous learning and be current in their knowledge and skills during
this period. Eligible instructors may claim $7.50 per hour for CCE training/events,
up to a maximum of $300 per person until 31 March 2022. Recognised training
includes CCE courses facilitated by CoachSG, and selected courses offered
under Union Training Assistance Programme (UTAP) endorsed by the National
Instructors and Coaches Association (NICA). We will continue to evaluate
programmes from other training providers, to expand the training opportunities
available to coaches and fitness instructors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enterprise Innovation and Capability Development Grant:</strong> Businesses
in the sport and fitness industry can continue to benefit from the SportSG
Enterprise Innovation and Capability Development Grant (InnoGrant). To
date, 2 waves of the InnoGrant have concluded, with 21 enterprises receiving
more than S$2M in funding to develop and apply innovative technology solutions
to take their businesses to the next level. More details on the next application
window will be released in the coming months.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other Support Measures</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eligible National Registry of Coaches (NROC)-registered coaches and instructors
with valid membership will receive a <strong>one-year extension to their existing membership.</strong> Over
6,200 memberships will benefit from this extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SportSG is also extending support for Swimsafer coaches by <strong>waiving usage permit fees</strong> and
providing <strong>one-year complimentary swimming pool entry access</strong> to
all ActiveSG swimming pools from June 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEPs in the sport sector may also apply to use <strong>ActiveSG spaces for classes and/or filming</strong>.
These are controlled and supervised “white-listed” spaces where we will
enforce strict safe management measures (SMMs), and their use is subject
to availability of venues and compliance with SMMs. In order to ensure
responsible booking for such spaces, a refundable deposit will be required.
This deposit will only be forfeited for no-shows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SportSG will continue to consult and work closely with businesses and
SEPs in the sport and fitness industry to find solutions and workarounds
to ground issues. Industry partners may also sign up for SportSG’s Ask
Me More sessions to seek clarifications or contribute perspectives. Information
on the full list of SRP support measures, eligibility criteria and application
details can be accessed on the ActiveSG Circle at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/srp2020" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/srp2020</a>.</p>
