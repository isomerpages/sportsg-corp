### **SportSG updates Sport Resilience Package for businesses and SEPs**

The recent tightening of measures under the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) has significantly impacted the sport and fitness industry. Sports and fitness are important to our health and well-being and the Government is committed to supporting the sector through this period.

**New Broad-based Measures**

2 SportSG has worked closely with MOF on broad-based measures to safeguard livelihoods in the sport and fitness industry and defray operating costs during this period.

3 Eligible businesses in the sports and fitness industry will receive 50% Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) support from 16 May onwards. These eligible businesses are gyms, fitness studios and other sport facilities that are classified under SSIC 93111, 93119, 93120 or 85410; and operate sports- and/or fitness-related programmes that are (i) conducted indoors without masks on prior to P2(HA); or (ii) for those 18 years and under prior to P2(HA).

4 Eligible sports and fitness businesses will also benefit from rental relief. For Government-owned commercial properties, the Government will grant one month of rental relief for qualifying tenants. For privately-owned commercial properties, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) will disburse a 0.5-month rental relief cash payout directly to qualifying tenants as part of the new Rental Support Scheme.

5 Self-employed persons in the sport and fitness sector who have experienced an income loss of at least 50% for at least one month, from 8 May to 30 June 2021, may apply for the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) scheme. Eligible individuals may receive a one-off payout of up to $500. The Ministry of Social and Family Development will release more details shortly.

**Updates to Sport Resilience Package Measures**

6 With the introduction of the above broad-based measures, there are updates to the $18M Sport Resilience Package measures announced on 11 May.

7 Sport and Fitness Operating Grant: The grant will provide additional support for more than 500 gyms and fitness studios. Eligible entities will receive a one-time disbursement ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 to defray operating costs, subject to prevailing criteria and eligibility for other available support measures. 400 applications have been received so far.

8 Following MOF’s announcement that eligible sport and fitness entities will be supported by the enhanced JSS and rental relief scheme from 16 May onwards, the Sport and Fitness Operating Grant amounts will be adjusted accordingly to cover a shorter period of 8 May – 15 May 2021. SportSG will be contacting those who had earlier applied for the Sport and Fitness Operating Grant on the outcome of their applications. Applications will close on 4 June 2021.

9 Sport and Fitness SEP Support Fund: We earlier announced the sport and fitness SEP support fund where eligible applicants will receive a one-time payment of up to $400.

10 Following MOF’s announcement, the Sport and Fitness SEP Support Fund will be subsumed under the new COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) scheme. We encourage sport and fitness SEPs to submit their applications for the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) scheme.

11 **SEP Project Grant:** This grant is open to self-employed fitness professionals, freelance coaches and instructors. The first round of applications was conducted on 17 May 2021 in a hackathon format, a sprint-like event for participants to ideate and create innovative content together. SportSG provided guidance as participants formulated their proposals. Close to 40 projects comprising individual or group participants have been awarded with about $315,000 to date.

12 A second round of applications was launched from 20 to 26 May with more than 200 applications received. SportSG will be organising a briefing and training session to assist applicants who are new to producing digital content. Details on the next application window will be released in due course.

**Updates to Existing Measures under Sport Resilience Package**

13 **Continuing Coach Education (CCE) Training Allowance Grant:** Training grants have been extended to include fitness instructors to actively engage in continuous learning and be current in their knowledge and skills during this period. Eligible instructors may claim $7.50 per hour for CCE training/events, up to a maximum of $300 per person until 31 March 2022. Recognised training includes CCE courses facilitated by CoachSG, and selected courses offered under Union Training Assistance Programme (UTAP) endorsed by the National Instructors and Coaches Association (NICA). We will continue to evaluate programmes from other training providers, to expand the training opportunities available to coaches and fitness instructors.

14 **Enterprise Innovation and Capability Development Grant:** Businesses in the sport and fitness industry can continue to benefit from the SportSG Enterprise Innovation and Capability Development Grant (InnoGrant). To date, 2 waves of the InnoGrant have concluded, with 21 enterprises receiving more than S$2M in funding to develop and apply innovative technology solutions to take their businesses to the next level. More details on the next application window will be released in the coming months.

**Other Support Measures**

15 Eligible National Registry of Coaches (NROC)-registered coaches and instructors with valid membership will receive a **one-year extension to their existing membership.** Over 6,200 memberships will benefit from this extension.

16 SportSG is also extending support for Swimsafer coaches by **waiving usage permit fees** and providing **one-year complimentary swimming pool entry access** to all ActiveSG swimming pools from June 2021.

17 SEPs in the sport sector may also apply to use **ActiveSG spaces for classes and/or filming**. These are controlled and supervised “white-listed” spaces where we will enforce strict safe management measures (SMMs), and their use is subject to availability of venues and compliance with SMMs. In order to ensure responsible booking for such spaces, a refundable deposit will be required. This deposit will only be forfeited for no-shows.

18 SportSG will continue to consult and work closely with businesses and SEPs in the sport and fitness industry to find solutions and workarounds to ground issues. Industry partners may also sign up for SportSG’s Ask Me More sessions to seek clarifications or contribute perspectives.
