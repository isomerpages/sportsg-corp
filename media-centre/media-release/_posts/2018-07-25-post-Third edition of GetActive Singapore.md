**Singapore, 25 July 2018** – GetActive! Singapore returns for a third year as the national week of sport continues to offer an extensive line-up of sporting activities and competitions for everyone from 28 July onwards, right up to National Day.

Participants will have more than 300 ground-up Active Enabler activities to choose from. Highlights include unconventional sporting activities such as Parkour, Paintball, Abseiling and even Pillow Fights for Singaporeans to learn and take part in. Some activities will also fuse technology with physical activity where one can play dodgeball or laser tag using Augmented Reality.

Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer of Sport Singapore said, “We are delighted this year to see new and interesting activities lined up for everyone. We are also giving emphasis in this year’s celebrations to caring for others.  Reaching out and encouraging those who need care and support gives added meaning to our coming together to have fun through sport and physical activity. I applaud all the partners who have rallied behind this call.”

In collaboration with SG Cares, this year’s Active Enabler Programme will also see 90% of their activities organised to inspire Singaporeans to be more civic-minded. These activities encourage people to help others or volunteer for a cause; and in the process, benefit under-served communities or non-profit organisations in Singapore. _(Refer to list of Active Enabler Programme in Annex C)_

Singaporeans can expect to see more sport festivals springing up near their homes. There will be 12 sport festival sites located both in the heartlands and at iconic areas of Singapore. This includes new locations at heritage places such as Chinatown, Little India and Geylang Serai. It will also be the first time a sport festival will be held at the Singapore Turf Club in Kranji, where people can get up close to the horses. The Singapore Sports Hub will also see a slew of activities, including the Inclusive Sports Festival by SportCares and YOUTHX by the National Youth Council. _(Refer to list of Sport Festivals in Annex B and Event Booklet)_

As part of a partnership agreement signed between Sport Singapore and Great Eastern Holdings, both parties will co-activate a new digital challenge titled **_GetActive! GetGreat_**. The challenge allows participants can chalk up points by either clocking steps on their ActiveSG app, visiting GetActive! Singapore sport festivals across the island or by booking facilities and programmes at sports centres. Prizes up to $5,800 are up for grabs. _(Refer to list of GetActive! Get Great Challenge details in Annex A)_

**_GetActive! GetGreat_** will be the first of many initiatives to come, as part of a tie-up between Sport Singapore and Great Eastern to encourage Singaporeans to adopt an Active Health lifestyle.

Commented Mr Khor Hock Seng, Group CEO, Great Eastern, “We are delighted to partner Sport Singapore who share our aspirations in championing health and wellness to the community. We recognise that maintaining good health is important to Singaporeans.

We recently launched GETGREAT, the first-of-its-kind mobile wellness platform with a wellness coach, GERI, powered by artificial intelligence, which offers personalised coaching 24/7 to nudge users towards their personal wellness goals. To date, GETGREAT users have chalked up a massive 4.5 billion steps, through 800,000 interactions with GERI.

Great Eastern is also actively exploring ways to enhance the value we bring to the ActiveSG community; we plan to offer insurance solutions specially for the ActiveSG community at affordable premiums.”

There will be collaborations ahead where the community can earn both Active SG points as well as GETGREAT rewards through healthy activities.

Welcoming the new partner on board, Mr Lim said, “We are happy to partner Great Eastern in furthering our common belief and conviction that everyone can be healthy and well. This partnership will enable us to creatively nudge Singaporeans to take positive steps to take ownership of the journey towards enjoying the fruits of being at their best.”

**Hitting record numbers - Singapore National Games**

The biennial Singapore National Games will also return this year as athletes from all over Singapore will come together once again to compete against one another. So far, the registration has more than 15,000 sign-ups for a total of 22 sports and eight para sports. This is the highest since it was started in 2014. This year’s prize money will also be the largest with a total of S$250,000.

The challenge is open for individuals as well as for families and friends who prefer to sign up as a team. Participants will have to complete gruelling challenges over a period of time to win attractive prizes.
