### **New National Water Safety Programme With Emphasis On Water Survival Skills Introduced**

_SwimSafer to replace Learn-To-Swim Programme and National Survival Swimming Award, with emphasis on drowning prevention_

**Singapore, 18 March 2010** - A new national water safety programme, SwimSafer was introduced today with the aim of imparting Singaporeans, especially children, with the necessary water safety knowledge and a wide range of water survival skills as a safeguard against drowning. This came about when the National Water Safety Council (NWSC) called for a review of the existing national water safety programmes in July 2008, and it was construed that a single national framework with an emphasis on drowning prevention was needed.

2. SwimSafer is an amalgamated and improved version of the Learn-To-Swim Programme (LTSP) and the National Survival Swimming Award (NASSA), and will replace both the latter to be the only national water safety programme. In addition, a programme that instructs both swimming proficiency and water survival skills is necessary in view of more than 65% of drowning incidences in Singapore (from 2005 to 2008) occurring in the seas, rivers and reservoirs.

3. Commenting on the SwimSafer programme, Dr Teo Ho Pin Chairman of NWSC and Mayor of North West Community Development Council, said, "Water safety awareness and skills are critical in preventing drowning. The SwimSafer programme is a result of a vigorous consultative process with the various stakeholders such as the schools, instructors and parents. I hope that with the introduction of the SwimSafer programme, which is the national gold standard in swimming and water survival proficiency, children of all ages will be equipped with the necessary swimming and water survival skills that will enable them to have a fun and safe swim."

4. The SwimSafer programme comprises six stages - SwimSafer Stage 1 and progressively, Stage 2, Stage 3, Bronze, Silver and Gold (refer to Annex A) - that incorporate the essential elements of swimming, water survival and life saving skills to prepare students to react appropriately when faced with sudden and adverse aquatic situations.

5. These six stages would be taught and tested within the confines of a swimming pool setting. In addition, a separate open water module known as SwimSafer Open Water would be introduced as an entry requirement for water sports entrants. Students who have completed SwimSafer Bronze Stage would be encouraged to take the open water course before venturing into open water sports.

6. SwimSafer will be rolled out at public swimming pools on 5 July 2010. With this, it would mean that all instructors teaching at any of the Singapore Sports Council's (SSC) 24 swimming complexes will have to be SwimSafer certified, as well as conducting swimming classes based on the SwimSafer syllabus.

7. To get instructors SwimSafer certified, the SSC will be holding induction courses for the first batch of 500 instructors registered under the SSC's Sports and Recreation Centres' Usage Permit Holders, from April to May 2010. More such courses will be held throughout the year.

8. "As the lead agency for sports in Singapore, and the largest owner and operator of public swimming pools, the Singapore Sports Council continually strives to provide a safe and enjoyable swimming environment for the public. We see the immense value that the SwimSafer programme can bring to young Singaporeans-that is to allow them to be confident and safe in the waters," said Mr Kenneth Hui, Chief of Sports Facilities Group, SSC.

9. For more information on the SwimSafer programme, the public can visit [www.sportsingapore.gov.sg](www.sportsingapore.gov.sg) or call the hotline at 6500 5439 (operational from 22 March 2010 onwards) from Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm.

**About the National Water Safety Council, Singapore (NWSC)**<br>
The NWSC was appointed by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) in 2007 to oversee water safety matters in Singapore. Helmed by Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mayor of North West Community Development Council and Honorary Advisor to the Singapore Life Saving Society, the NWSC is the national coordinating body in driving and sustaining initiatives overseeing water safety. The Council, appointed on a two-year term, comprises members from the people, private and public sectors. Prior to the SwimSafer, the NWSC had collaborated with the Ministry of Education and Singapore Sports Council to introduce the Learn-To-Swim Programme for primary school students. The Council is currently working with SPRING Singapore and other agencies to develop a Code of Practice for Aquatic Facilities to promote safe water facilities for the public.
