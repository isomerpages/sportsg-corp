### **SSC and Western Australia Sports Institutions To Strengthen Ties In Areas Of Sports Safety And High Performance**

Singapore, 8 December 2009 - Aiming to further develop friendly relations and sports collaborations between Singapore and the State of Western Australia, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Western Australian Department of Sport and Recreation (WA, DSR), Royal Life Saving Society, Western Australia (RLSS, WA) and Western Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS) today at the Float @ Marina Bay. The MOU will enhance and facilitate sporting exchanges and cooperation in the areas of high performance and sports safety

2. "This MOU formalises our existing commitment to share knowledge and enhance our mutual capabilities in the development and promotion of sports and recreation. Through stronger cooperation and collaboration, we will see greater achievements in sports safety, sports science and high performance specifically, as well as the development of research and educational resources for use by all." said Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer of SSC.

3. Mr Ron Alexander, Director General (WA, DSR) said, "The Western Australian Department of Sport and Recreation believes that sport and recreation has a big role to play in creating stronger, healthier and happier communities, and therefore we are very happy to share our experience and expertise with our Singapore neighbours. We are particularly keen to help develop strategies to increase participation in sport, which in turn will result in success at the elite level."

**Cooperation in Sports Safety**<br>

4. A key area of cooperation under the MOU is Sports Safety. The MOU will enhance cooperation between the parties to promote exchanges in sports safety frameworks, best practices, campaigns, and research developments with the goal of fostering a sports safety culture through accelerated learning and outreach to the public.

5. Both parties will help develop a safety validation framework and enhance training in risk and incident management for Singapore. This will help build Singapore's capability for sports risk and incident management and directly help equip stakeholders like the National Sports Associations and event organisers with the skills necessary to assess hazards and provide mitigation for sports events.

6. "For a start, we'll be working together with the Royal Life Saving Society, Western Australia to promote and provide training in risk management, incident management and investigation. This is a continuation of our efforts to champion and develop sports safety practices in Singapore as laid out in the Sports Safety Implementation Plan launched in 2008," said Ms Delphine Fong, Director for Sports Safety, SSC.

7. Mr Alex McKenzie, Executive Director, RLSS, WA said, "Royal Life Saving is very pleased to be associated with the Singapore Sports Council over the last few years. The MOU further develops this relationship to enable the sharing of ideas and programs that are designed to make sport safer. This ongoing collaboration will ensure that together we can make sport a safer and enjoyable experience for all."

**Cooperation in High Performance**<br>

8. The MOU caters for high-level sports delegation visits between SSC and WAIS to facilitate exchange of views and sharing of information in the areas of sports science, sports medicine and research and development. This cooperation may extend to athletes to use Singapore and Western Australia as their training hubs to prepare for international competitions.

9. "The formalisation of the relationship developed over the past five years between WAIS and the Singapore Sports Council through this MOU provides the opportunity for even closer ties between our high performance coaches and scientists," said Mr Grant Boyce, Chairman (WAIS), "we look forward to developing specific projects of mutual benefit to Western Australian and Singaporean athletes."

10. "We are very pleased to work with WAIS over the years and it is timely to make our relationship official. The MOU will present us more opportunities to share and learn from each other, especially in the areas of Sports Science and Coaching. I am confident that athletes, coaches and officials from Singapore and Western Australia will benefit substantially from our enhanced collaboration efforts," said Mr Bob Gambardella, Chief of Sports Development & Singapore Sports Institute.
