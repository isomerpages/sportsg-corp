**Singapore, 24 October 2013** - A 'Join #ourteamsg' movement to call on Singaporeans to come together as one Team Singapore in support of our national athletes kicked off today, as part of a nationwide campaign titled 'Together We Are Stronger'. For the very first time, Singaporeans will also be able to put a face to their well wishes to the athletes through the submission of photo pledges via Instagram at #ourteamsg.

2. Helmed by the Singapore Sports Council and supported by the Singapore National Olympic Council, Singapore National Paralympic Council and their partners, the idea of the campaign is to forge greater affinity between our national athletes and Singaporeans by drawing on truly Singaporean traits. Stories of people from all walks of life - from hawkers to teachers and neighbours - who have supported and encouraged our athletes in their own unique ways will be showcased. Singaporeans will also get a chance to see a more personal side to the athletes and connect with them on an even deeper level. Ultimately, the campaign hopes to garner support for the contingent heading to the 27th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and 7th ASEAN Para Games in Myanmar.

3. Speaking at the event, Mr Toh Boon Yi, Chief, Strategic Development and Marketing Group, Singapore Sports Council, said: "The campaign reinforces the fact that all of us are part of Team Singapore, and our collective strength is derived from the staunch support Singaporeans give to our athletes. Hence, the tagline 'Together We Are Stronger'. The visuals press home the point that our athletes are anchored in our neighbourhood and we share a lot of common everyday experience, be it going to the same school or frequenting the same hawker stall. We hope that by drawing on these connections, the affinity between athletes and Singaporeans can be further strengthened."

**River Valley High leads the movement**

4. Some 270 River Valley High School (RV) student athletes became the first group in Singapore to join the #ourteamsg movement by showing their support through a human formation. Athletes featured in the campaign such as runners Calvin Kang, Muhd Naqib Asmin and paralympic swimmer Yip Pin Xiu also joined other SEA Games bound athletes in a sports forum and clinic with RV student athletes to share their sporting experiences (see Appendix A for full list of athletes featured in the campaign).

5. Team Singapore athlete Calvin Kang, who is part of the men's relay team, shared at the event: "Being an athlete requires a great deal of focus, hard work and sacrifice. There are good days and bad days, and there will be times when you feel like giving up. For that, I am thankful to have the support of my coaches, friends, family, and fellow Singaporeans as they really motivate us to strive harder in preparing for the Games."

6. The public may log on to www.ourteamsg.com to find out more about the stories between Team Singapore athletes and their team of supporters.
