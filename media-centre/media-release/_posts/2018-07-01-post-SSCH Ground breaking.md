**Singapore, 1 July 2018** –  From the first half of 2020, residents of Sembawang will have a uniquely designed **Bukit Canberra** – an integrated sport and community hub, that will inspire them to live better. To be opened in phases, the 12-hectare hub will provide amenities such as a hawker centre, indoor and outdoor sport facilities, a polyclinic, a senior care centre, green spaces for community farming and lifestyle related amenities for the community within a lush and naturalistic environment.

“Bukit Canberra is both a historical treasure and the brainchild of our residents. We have been engaging Sembawang residents since 2016 to co-create a vibrant gathering place for our residents and families. The general consensus was to conserve the greenery as much as possible, and at the same time put in place useful facilities that the community finds most useful. So by 2020, we will have swimming pools, a hawker centre, a polyclinic and an indoor sports hall nestled in a nature and heritage park. It will be a special place in Sembawang and Singapore.” said Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education and Adviser to Sembawang GRC Grassroots Organisations.

Since the Sembawang Sport and Community Hub was first announced in 2016, grassroots volunteers have been engaging residents through house visits to gather ideas on possible facilities and programmes. One of the main takeaways was that they hoped to see more areas for community activities to socialise with their fellow residents of Sembawang.

Mr Ong, together with his fellow Advisers to Sembawang GRC Grassroots Organisations – Minister Khaw Boon Wan, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amrin Amin, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Vikram Nair joined over 800 residents at a family carnival on Sunday morning at the future site of Bukit Canberra to commemorate the start of construction works. Symbolising the start of works, the Grassroots Advisers planted the Sembawang Tree (scientific name: _Mesua ferruginea_) which will be part of the 1,600 additional trees that will be planted at Bukit Canberra.

Bukit Canberra will have facilities by Sport Singapore (SportSG), Ministry of Health (MOH), National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP), National Environment Agency (NEA) and National Parks Board (NParks). With inputs from National Heritage Board (NHB), Bukit Canberra will also highlight the heritage of the area.

**Greenery and Heritage**
<br>The development and landscaping of Bukit Canberra is shaped around the existing terrain, and retains and highlights the hilly characteristics and lush vegetation. More trees and shrubs will be planted throughout the entire site and be integrated with the various facilities to enhance the existing greenery and biodiversity, thereby allowing users to enjoy the hub’s features in a natural setting while at the same time bringing them closer to flora and fauna.

In line with the existing vegetation on site, a forest buffer around the periphery of Bukit Canberra will be conserved. It will be planted up progressively to help it mature into a tropical secondary rainforest with thriving biodiversity, and complement the surrounding NParks Nature Ways in terms of species. Running trails of varying difficulty will pass through different landscapes throughout the hub, providing a range of experiences. The Fruit Orchard and Food Forest will showcase a variety of fruit trees and food plants, and the community will be able to grow their own plants in the community gardens.

In addition, heritage story boards will be featured around the green spaces of Bukit Canberra for residents and visitors to learn more about the history of the area as a former naval base and its historic structures, including a National Monument – the Former Admiralty House that used to accommodate key military commanders based in Singapore.

**Health**
<br>Health and fitness will go hand-in-hand at Bukit Canberra by having sports and healthcare facilities such as a polyclinic, a senior care centre and sports facilities at the hub. This will allow the various agencies to work closely to help people improve their health and fitness.
