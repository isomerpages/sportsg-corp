</li>

<p>Singapore and Japan have enjoyed warm relations on the sporting front
over the last few years. This has contributed to the initiation of projects
even prior to yesterday's MOU signing. For example, the Singapore Sports
Institute (SSI) and Japan Institute of Sports Sciences (JISS) are presently
in discussions to develop shelf-stable athlete friendly meals with industry
partners, as well as embark on a collaborative study on Sports Physiology
amongst other things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking at the MOU signing ceremony, Mr Lim expressed optimism for this
collaboration. He said, "Our partnership today could not have come at a
better time in our sporting journey. Singapore has embarked on a new masterplan
called Vision 2030 to deliver quality sporting facilities and sporting
programmes for our people to live better through sports. I understand with
the launch of the Sport Basic Plan in March last year, Japan is also working
towards creating a society where everybody can enjoy a happy and fulfilled
life through sport. I see valuable synergies and am confident that through
our efforts and commitment, we will be able to achieve more and forge even
closer relationships and friendships between the sporting communities of
Singapore and Japan."</p>

<p>JSC President Ichiro Kono said, "Japan Sport Council have facilitated
a number of collaborative activities and exchanges with Singapore Sports
Council over the past few years. Today, we are pleased to formalise our
existing commitment to further build our strong and sustainable collaboration.
Through this partnership, we expect to bring great opportunities for both
sides to share and exchange expertise and experience in the fields from
sport promotion to high performance."</p>
