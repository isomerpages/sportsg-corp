**Singapore, 4 April 2013**  - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and the Japan Sport Council (JSC) signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in Tokyo yesterday, marking both parties' commitment to forge closer bonds in an effort to further develop sports in Singapore and Japan.

2. Signed during the SSC's study visit to Tokyo by SSC Chief Executive Officer Lim Teck Yin and JSC President Ichiro Kono, the agreement seeks to establish collaboration on a number of key areas, such as the:
* Exchange of expertise on the development of sports programmes, including at the grassroots level
* Exchange of information on coaching education and development
* Exchange of information on sport industries such as the research and development of equipment and materials
* Co-operation on research on sports science, medicine, and intelligence for high performance sports
* Exchange of knowledge on implementation, project management, and operations of sports facilities such as the National Stadium

3. Singapore and Japan have enjoyed warm relations on the sporting front over the last few years. This has contributed to the initiation of projects even prior to yesterday's MOU signing. For example, the Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) and Japan Institute of Sports Sciences (JISS) are presently in discussions to develop shelf-stable athlete friendly meals with industry partners, as well as embark on a collaborative study on Sports Physiology amongst other things.

4. Speaking at the MOU signing ceremony, Mr Lim expressed optimism for this collaboration. He said, "Our partnership today could not have come at a better time in our sporting journey. Singapore has embarked on a new masterplan called Vision 2030 to deliver quality sporting facilities and sporting programmes for our people to live better through sports. I understand with the launch of the Sport Basic Plan in March last year, Japan is also working towards creating a society where everybody can enjoy a happy and fulfilled life through sport. I see valuable synergies and am confident that through our efforts and commitment, we will be able to achieve more and forge even closer relationships and friendships between the sporting communities of Singapore and Japan."

5. JSC President Ichiro Kono said, "Japan Sport Council have facilitated a number of collaborative activities and exchanges with Singapore Sports Council over the past few years. Today, we are pleased to formalise our existing commitment to further build our strong and sustainable collaboration. Through this partnership, we expect to bring great opportunities for both sides to share and exchange expertise and experience in the fields from sport promotion to high performance."
