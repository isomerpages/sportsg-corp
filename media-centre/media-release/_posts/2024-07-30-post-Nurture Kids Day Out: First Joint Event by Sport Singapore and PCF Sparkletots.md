<p><em>Into its seventh year, this is the first time that Sport Singapore is working directly with a preschool operator on the annual Nurture Kids event, empowering early childhood educators to think creatively and implement innovative strategies for preschoolers</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 30 July 2024 </strong>– More than 3,200 preschoolers,
educators and parents from selected PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots
preschools islandwide came together to the OCBC Arena today, for a movement
and play experience that encourages movement throughout the day. All these
activities were designed by early childhood educators from PCF Sparkletots,
who have gone through a six-month capability development campaign with
Sport Singapore (SportSG) on how to integrate movement as a way of life
for preschoolers. &nbsp;This is the first time SportSG is collaborating
with a preschool anchor operator to co-organise the GetActive! Singapore
Nurture Kids event. The partnership with PCF Sparkletots seeks to empower
and motivate early childhood educators to think of innovative ways to get
young children to keep active.</p>
<p>Held annually since 2018, the Nurture Kids Festival has been renamed ‘Nurture
Kids Day Out’ for the 2024 edition. Nurture Kids Day Out provides an opportunity
to showcase the outcomes of the partnership between SportSG and PCF Sparkletots
beyond the educator’s own classroom and centre. With parents joining their
children at the event, Nurture Kids Day Out also highlights PCF Sparkletots'
commitment to fostering a strong home-school partnership. This collaboration
encourages active and integrated learning, empowering parents to apply
the insights gained during the event in their home environment.</p>
<p>The event was graced by Guest-of-Honour, Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Minister of
State for the Ministry of Digital Development and Information &amp; Ministry
of Health, who is also an EXCO Member of PCF.</p>
<p>SportSG’s Chief of Sport Development Group Marcus Tan said, “SportSG regularly
engages the preschool sector to understand how we could work with them
to incorporate fundamental movement skills as part of the holistic development
for our children. These engagements have led to strong partnerships with
many preschool operators such as PCF Sparkletots. Our partnerships allow
us to train early childhood educators with the necessary knowledge and
competencies to introduce fundamental movement skills into their classes.
We also share our resources and expertise, as well as curate programmes
or events together to sustain these efforts beyond the classroom. SportSG
will continue to upskill our early childhood educators through our capability
development workshops so that they would inculcate in preschoolers a love
for moving, fostering lifelong habits of physical well-being and sport
participation.”</p>
<p>Angela Yang, Director, Professional &amp; Education Development, PCF,
said, “At PCF Sparkletots, we are dedicated to providing a holistic education
that fosters the development of healthy and wholesome children. Our collaboration
with SportSG exemplifies this commitment by enhancing active learning and
emphasising the importance of physical activity for preschoolers in every
aspect of their growth and development. Our educators continually strive
to design innovative and enjoyable activities that enrich the learning
experiences for children. This partnership also offers a valuable opportunity
to engage both children and their parents. Together, we create a nurturing
and active environment where children can thrive and develop healthy habits
that will last a lifetime.”</p>
<p><strong>Fostering Innovation through SportSG-PCF Sparkletots Partnership</strong>
</p>
<p>Following the launch of the ‘Fun Start Move Smart – Learning to Move,
Moving to Learn’ Resource Guide, SportSG has been focusing on capability
development efforts with the early childhood educator sector. The guide,
which emphasises the importance of getting children to move throughout
the day, was developed with the intention of helping preschoolers become
confident and competent as they develop a love for moving and a strong
foundation for a happy, active and healthy life. Since the launch of the
guide, SportSG has been working closely with PCF Sparkletots to raise awareness
of the resource guide among the centres’ early childhood educators, and
drive adoption of the resource guide in all PCF Sparkletots centres.</p>
<p>To further develop capabilities among early childhood educators and to
drive the adoption of the resource guide, SportSG and PCF Sparkletots jointly
launched the Active Innovator Campaign, a six-month long campaign which
began in March 2024 and involved 60 early childhood educators selected
from PCF Sparkletots’ schools islandwide. Through these workshops, educators
would brainstorm and explore innovative strategies for integrating fundamental
movement skills into their classes. These would then be introduced directly
into their respective preschools to integrate movement as a way of life
for the preschoolers.</p>
<p>As part of PCF Sparkletots’ project implementation for the Active Innovator
Campaign, this year’s Nurture Kids Day Out serves as a showcase for the
innovative movement strategies and activity ideas that have been developed
by the workshop attendees. These ideas are developed from the “Integrated
Movement Approach” segment of the ‘Fun Start Move Smart – Learning to Move,
Moving to Learn’ Resource Guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exciting Activities Featured at Nurture Kids Day Out and Beyond</strong>
</p>
<p>Nurture Kids Day Out is one of the key events under GASG 2024, the annual
National Day celebration through sport. This year, GASG runs from 27 July
to 11 August, with offerings for everyone – no matter their background
or ability – to connect and bond, while embracing an active lifestyle.</p>
<p>Nurture Kids Day Out features four activity zones – the “Active Play Corner”
zone, the “Integrated Learning” zone, the “Brain Breaks” zone, and the
“Creative” zone - as well as Active Navigation Routes, with more than 20
different activities available. Collectively, these innovative solutions
look to get more preschoolers to hit the recommended 180 minutes of physical
activity a day.</p>
<p>In line with the spirit of National Day, a number of these activities
presented include a Singapore-related theme, with landmarks in Singapore
and the favourite local pastime of food represented in many of the submissions.
As such, beyond Nurture Kids Day Out, some of these activities – Exploring
Singapore: A Hopscotch and Tunnel Adventure Celebrating National Day, Hover
Over The Orchid, and I’m a SCDF Firefighter – will also be sent to all
PCF Sparkletots preschools, as part of the centres’ National Day celebrations.
This extends the reach of these outstanding and innovative activity ideas,
further integrating active play into the National Day activities, while
also maximising impact across all of PCF Sparkletots preschool centres.
More details on these three projects can be found in <strong>Annex A</strong>.</p>
<p>The Active Innovator Campaign, an official partnership between SportSG
and PCF Sparkletots, will come to a close in late September at the PCF
Sparkletots Future Ready Fair, where the educators who developed innovative
projects during the Active Innovator Campaign will walk away with the ‘Active
Innovator Award’. Winners will be selected by a panel of representatives
from both PCF Sparkletots and SportSG.</p>
<p>Beyond Nurture Kids Day Out and the Active Innovator Campaign, SportSG
also seeks to encourage more early childhood educators like PCF Sparkletots
to continuously adopt the resources, teaching approach and initiatives
gained throughout such partnerships to integrate movement as a way of life
in their curriculum.</p>
