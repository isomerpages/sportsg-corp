<h3><strong>Booking of ActiveSG Facilities</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Sport Singapore (SportSG) is aware of the unscrupulous practice of a few
ActiveSG members who breach the terms and conditions of our booking policy
by using software scripts to book facilities with the aim of profiting
through the on-selling of these. Such behaviour is wrong, and deprives
other ActiveSG members who genuinely want to play sports at our facilities
at affordable prices.</p>
<p>We have been monitoring the accounts of such on-sellers and have, over
a period of time, blacklisted and suspended 255 accounts. To further deter
such practices, we will also regularly deploy counter measures, in the
appropriate cases. As such measures could also adversely affect the convenience
and ease of bookings for the genuine majority of members, we deploy them
judiciously, but will step up enforcement if these practices go unabated.
We have already stepped up on-site enforcement measures, and hirers of
the courts are required to be present or the booking will be cancelled.</p>
<p>We will consider imposing stricter penalties against any errant members,
some of whom have gone further to encourage others to “lend” their accounts
to them for such purposes.</p>
<p>These could include increasing suspensions and permanently barring them
and their accomplices from booking all public facilities, and working with
other facility owners to do the same. We should add that on-selling is
absolutely prohibited, and no one should be procuring public sports facilities
from such on-sellers. If we have evidence of on-selling of facilities,
we will cancel the bookings, and in these circumstances, the paying customers
of on-sellers may also find that they will not be allowed to play when
they show up at the sport centres. We therefore strongly encourage genuine
enthusiasts not to purchase bookings from such on-sellers.</p>
<p>We recognise our ActiveSG members’ desire to play their favourite sport
and will continue to establish interest groups where they can play with
the same regularity as they now do.</p>
<p>We will continue to remind our ActiveSG members not to engage in scripting
as exploiting the system and profiteering are infringements of Sport Singapore’s
Terms of Use for ActiveSG facilities. Members are encouraged to contact
us at <a href="mailto:sport_qsm@sport.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sport_qsm@sport.gov.sg </a>if
they become aware of specific instances of this happening.</p>
<p>With everyone’s cooperation, we can keep the booking system fair and affordable
to all genuine sport enthusiasts.</p>
