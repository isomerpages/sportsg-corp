### **Target: 30 To 33 Medals For Team Singapore At The 16th ASIAD In Guangzhou**

_Largest Contingent To Feature At The Asian Games Will Take Part In 22 Of 42 Sports Events_

**Singapore, 3 November 2010** - Team Singapore is looking to better its performance by bringing home a total of between 30 to 33 medals at the 16th Asian Games in Guangzhou. This, if achieved, will be Team Singapore's most successful outing at the Asian Games to-date. The contingent's feature at the previous Games in 2006 saw a haul of 27 medals, coming from nine sports.

2. Team Singapore is not only sending its largest contingent (241 athletes and 120 officials) to the Asian Games since the nation's first participation in 1951, she is also increasing the breadth of her participation by competing in 22 of the 42 events featured. This is compared to only 16 sports at the last Asiad in Doha.

3. With the addition of the dragon boat team to the contingent, Team Singapore is also participating in the most number of team sports in the history of its participation at the quadrennial event, showing the depth and growth in the nation's sporting scene over the past four years.

4. Leading the team as Chef-de-Mission is Mr Low Teo Ping, Vice-President of the Singapore National Olympic Committee and the President of the Singapore Rugby Union. Mr Low is also a Vice President of the International Sailing Federation and an advisor of the Singapore Athletic Association and was previously Chef-de-Mission to the Singapore contingent in the 2007 SEA Games in Korat, Thailand.

5. The honour of carrying the Singapore flag this year rests with the celebrated female bowler Jasmine Yeong-Nathan. At the 16th Asian Games Guangzhou 2010 Flag Presentation ceremony held at Dunman High School today, Jasmine received the Singapore flag from CDM Low Teo Ping. The 2006 Asian Games gold medallist sailor Roy Tay then led the Team Singapore contingent in reciting the National Pledge.

6. Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister, Mr Teo Chee Hean, who is also the President of the Singapore National Olympic Council, was the Guest-of-Honour at the Flag Presentation Ceremony. DPM Teo said, "I am proud to note that more team sports have qualified on merit for the Asian Games, and this year we will be sending teams to represent Singapore in five team sports events, namely in Water-Polo, Football, Rugby (Women's), Hockey and Dragon Boat where both the men's and women's teams have made the cut."

**Promising Performances**

7. Following Team Singapore's stellar performance at the recently concluded Commonwealth Games (where 31 medals were clinched in total), public expectations on the team's showing at the 16th Asiad are high. But the athletes are all fully prepared and raring to take on Asia's best to show that Singapore is a sporting force to be reckoned with.

8. A whopping 83% (199 out of 241) of the contingent are debutants to the Asian Games. The Team Singapore contingent is also relatively young, with 98 members who are 21 years and younger, with the youngest being 13-year-old optimist sailor Ryan Loh Jun Han. The oldest member is 49-year-old Elise Lee Shi May who is the steerswoman of the women's dragon boat team.

9. Shooting will feature 22 Team Singapore athletes in the coming Asian Games. The line-up includes Commonwealth gold medalists Gai Bin, Lim Swee Hon, Poh Lip Meng, Jasmine Ser and Aqilah Sudhir.

10. Sailing, which contributed five out of eight gold medals at the 2006 Asian Games, is looking to make a dash for gold again. 20 sailors are headed for Guangzhou this time, including Olympian Tan Wearn Haw, 2006 Asiad gold medallists Roy Tay and Teo Wee Chin as well as Asian Sailing Championships bronze medallists Siobhan Tam and Dawn Li.

11. Having done Singapore proud at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October this year, gymnasts Lim Heem Wei, Singapore's first-ever silver medalist for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, and bronze medalist David Jonathan Chan, will also be competing in the Asiad. Also in the contingent is Singapore's golden team - the table tennis team that has been participating in various competitions ever since the Commonwealth Games ended to further prepare themselves for the Games in Guangzhou.

12. Swimmer Tao Li made a splash at the previous Asian Games in 2006 when she surprised Singapore, and the world, by clinching the gold medal at the 50m Butterfly event. This time round, she is looking to defend her title, as well as make her presence felt in the other events. Team Singapore's swimming contingent also includes four young swimmers who had represented Singapore at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. They are silver medallist Rainer Ng, Clement Lim, Pang Sheng Jun and Amanda Lim.

13. "We have assembled a sterling cast of athletes for this edition of the Asian Games. I know everyone's ready to do their best and in doing so, I am certain they will bring glory to Singapore and perhaps write a new glorious chapter in our sporting history," said CDM Mr Low who hopes to see all Team Singapore athletes participate with sportsmanship high on their agenda.

14. "To our athletes - do your best to win but do not do it at all costs. It is always important to uphold the values of sportsmanship whenever Team Singapore athletes participate in any events, and when we wear the national flag across our chests."

**Following Team Singapore's Action on New Media**

15. For the first time in history, fans can now keep up with Team Singapore in action through SingaporeSports.tv, a free to access online portal launched by the Singapore Sports Council that will provide 'live' feeds of the sports events that feature Team Singapore athletes as they take place in Guangzhou.

16. For Singaporeans and members of the public who have missed the 'live' action, they can also log on to the online portal and click on 'Sports on Demand' to view video clips of the highlights during the Games.

17. Apart from providing 'live' feeds during major Games, SingaporeSports.tv will also feature major sporting events such as the upcoming Singapore Cricket Club Rugby 7s taking place from 5 November to 7 November, as well as the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore on 5 December.

18. Members of the public can also follow Team Singapore's recently launched Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/TeamSG) which provides fans with minute by minute updates during key events at the Games, quotes, results and photographs of Team Singapore?s athletes in action.

**Annex C: Profile of Chef-de-Mission**<br>

Low Teo Ping<br>
Chef-de-Mission, Team Singapore

Currently the Vice President of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and President of the Singapore Rugby Union, Mr Low Teo Ping was awarded the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal) by the President of Singapore in 2006 for his outstanding contribution to sports. He is also a member of the Singapore Sports Council, Vice President of the International Sailing Federation and Advisor to the Singapore Athletic Association.

Mr Low played rugby for Singapore in the 1960's and had also competed in regional sailing regattas in Malaysia, Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan and Indonesia. He juggles his sporting career alongside a very successful career in banking spanning over 38 years. He has a distinguished track record as a Chef-de-Mission (CDM) to Team Singapore; his last stint as CDM saw Team Singapore bringing back 43 Gold medals and a medal haul of 127 medals at the 2007 Southeast Asian Games in Thailand.

Mr Low is truly a veteran sporting figure in Singapore that Team Singapore athletes can look up to. He believes that by staying focused and with commitment and passion, our athletes will put up a credible performance at the Asian Games.

He believes in this saying:
<br>"Winning is not a some-time thing; It's an all-time thing.
<br>You don't win once in a while,
<br>You don't do things right once in a while;
<br>You do them right all the time.
<br>WINNING IS A HABIT."

**About Singapore Sports Council**<br>
Formed in 1973, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is tasked with developing a holistic sports culture for the nation. The SSC creates opportunities for people to excel in sports; opportunities for people to be engaged in sports as, coaches, officials, volunteers or fans; and opportunities for people to do business in sports as sponsors and investors. The SSC has changed the way Singaporeans view and participate in sports. Through sports, we now have an enhanced national identity thanks to our sports participation programmes; greater national pride as a result of high performance results at international and regional games; and more diversified economic stability through our vibrant sports industry initiatives.

**About the Singapore National Olympic Council**<br>
The Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) is the national nonprofit organisation that coordinates the selection of Singaporean athletes for competition at the major games such as the Olympics, the Asian Games, the Commonwealth Games and the South East Asian Games. Singapore's involvement in the Games is resolutely anchored in the Olympic ideals that were first espoused by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, in 1894. For more information, please visit [www.snoc.org.sg](https://www.snoc.org.sg).

**About Team Singapore**<br>
Originally mooted by the then-Ministry of Community Development and Sports, and launched on 20 April 2001 by then-Deputy Prime Minister Dr Tony Tan, Team Singapore is the united identity of elite athletes, coaches and officials from Singapore that represents the country in major multi-sport Games and identified international competitions.

The three core attributes of Pride, Performance and Perseverance anchor that which is the collective Team Singapore. Underscoring the traits of a winning team, these attributes are the important elements of sportsmanship and excellence that propel the nation forward to succeed on the world's sporting stage.

Team Singapore inspires our nation's athletic talents to continually evolve the level of elite sports in Singapore, while galvanising and connecting the community in support of their sporting endeavours.
