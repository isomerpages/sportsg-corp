## **Singapore Sports Hub - Marking A New Chapter Of A Sporting Singapore**

SINGAPORE SPORTS HUB - MARKING A NEW CHAPTER OF A SPORTING SINGAPORE

**Singapore, September 29, 2010** - Singapore's sporting landscape marks a new and very significant milestone today with the official groundbreaking ceremony of the new Singapore Sports Hub.

2. A state-of-the-art facility in line with the Government's aim of creating a thriving sports, entertainment and lifestyle ecosystem, the Singapore Sports Hub, when built, will be Asia's best sports and entertainment facility and the pride of the Lion City.

3. "Over the past decade, Singapore has changed the way it perceives, plays and enjoys sports. By any measure, we are a true sporting nation. We play, we cheer, we excel and we work in sports. The new Sports Hub in Kallang is a bold confirmation of how much we have accomplished - and how much more we can do," said Mr Alex Chan, Chairman, Singapore Sports Council. "The Sports Hub will help us put in place the hardware and software that will not only benefit Sports Hub when it is up and running, but also spillover to all other areas of sports development in Singapore."

4. "SportsHub Pte Ltd is committed to furthering Singapore Sport, and the Singapore Sports Hub has been designed specifically with flexibility and multi-functionality in mind, which therefore allows for a variety of sports to be played there," said Ludwig Reichhold, Managing Director of Dragages Singapore, the lead partner of SportsHub Pte Ltd, owner and manager of the Singapore Sports Hub.

5. The new complex will be built on the site of the soon-to-be-demolished National Stadium, which, since 1973, has been the venue of choice for many national, regional and international sporting, entertainment and lifestyle events, including the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, 2004 Tiger Cup and 18 National Day Parades.

6 The Singapore Sports Hub - which incorporates the existing Singapore Indoor Stadium and comprise world-class facilities including a new 55,000-capacity National Stadium - will offer a plethora of exciting events and activities to suit Singaporeans of all ages.

7. Built to suit Singapore's tropical climate, the Sports Hub possesses features developed in response to the heat and humidity, thereby ensuring the best quality environment for athlete and spectator alike, while establishing a benchmark for environmentally sustainable stadium design.

8. In order to keep the Sports Hub humming with activity year-round, a full schedule of local, regional and international sports, entertainment and lifestyle events are set to capture the imagination and attention of the public. The primary aim is to establish a strong bond with Singaporeans as a national icon that will bring everyone together as a community - whether as participants, spectators or athletes.

9. "We are very excited to commence with the next crucial milestone of this new development. We aim to create a place that could not just host major international events, but also a leisure and recreation focal point for Singaporeans at large ? in short engaging all Singaporeans to partake in and contribute towards becoming a Sporting Singapore," said Mr Reichhold.

10. "The old National Stadium was an icon in its own right - where many of Singapore?s best memories were made. We can only aim to better this with the completion of what will be another national - and hopefully international - landmark, a place Singaporeans can look on with pride, and where everyone can do their part to create more lasting memories for Singapore."
