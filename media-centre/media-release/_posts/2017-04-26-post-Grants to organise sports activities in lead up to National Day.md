With more Singaporeans being active and understanding the benefits of sport, GetActive! Singapore’s Active Enabler Programme aims encourage even more people to organise sporting activities for their community of friends, school, or organisation/company.

Celebrating Singapore’s 52nd National Day through sport, GetActive! Singapore is bringing back the Active Enabler Programme for groups, schools, organisations and corporates to come forward and submit their proposals for creative sport-focused and lifestyle driven activities to be conducted from 29 July to 9 August 2017.

Last year, in the first edition of GetActive! Singapore, the Active Enabler Programme supported more than 240 ground-up applications. Similar to the first edition, the proposals submitted could be supported through provision of fitness instructors to conduct group fitness sessions, project grants of up to S$25,000 per project with more than 30 participants, and mass event grants of up to S$50,000 for mass events targeting more than 200 participants.

Head of GetActive! Singapore operations, Mr Lai Chin Kwang, is encouraged by last year’s submissions. “This is the second year that we are organising GetActive! Singapore, and we look forward to more people coming forward with even more exciting and engaging ideas, especially the corporates, to organise sporting activities for their staff. We hope that the Active Enabler Programme will be the catalyst for people to come forward and exercise their creative juices in getting Singaporeans active during this National Day period.”

Sports event organiser, RED-X Games and Strong Mind Fit Body are organisations that have submitted their proposals to be back again this year with its fitness challenges and events through the Active Enabler Programme.

Managing Director of Superfit, Founder of RED-X Games, Steffan Fung said “We realised it was great working with the community, which is why we want to be more inclusive this year, focusing on kids and family in our event. Our event is inspired by national events and milestones like National Service, growing-up games, and back breaking work carried out by our forefathers. RED-X Games is about living the legacy of the same ‘never-say-die’ spirit.”

Shereen Ng, Director of Strong Mind Fit Body is looking to be part of the Active Enabler Programme again this year with their event, “From Me to We” that hopes to reinvent the concept of physical activity amongst seniors, residents in the heartlands, and youth from various secondary schools. “This year, we hope to work with students and provide them the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of Singapore’s aging population and to showcase of the livelihood of common jobs taken by our pioneer generations. Through this experience, students and seniors alike would also get to experience workouts that can be done while on those jobs. The Active Enabler Programme has offered us a chance to bring different kinds of people together to plan and execute events. The grant is very accessible and allows anyone with clear objectives, an organised plan and passion for fitness, to roll out their events.”

In 2016, the Active Enabler Programme provided platforms for over 95,000 people to gather and have fun through sport. This year’s programme submission deadline has been extended till 19th May 2017.  Successful applicants will be informed by early June 2017.
