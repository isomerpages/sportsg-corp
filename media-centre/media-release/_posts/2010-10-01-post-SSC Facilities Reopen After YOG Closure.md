### **SSC Facilities Reopen After YOG Closure**

_Heartlanders And Local Sports Fraternity Set To Enjoy Legacy Of Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games Through Upgraded Sports Facilities_

**Singapore, 1 October 2010** - All Singapore Sports Council (SSC) facilities closed for the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) have completed reinstatement works following the Games and have been reopened for public use. The exceptions are Bishan Sports Hall, Bishan ClubFITT Gym and Tampines Bike Park. Further details are listed in Annex 1 below.

2. Said Mr Fan Chian Jen, Director, Facilities and F1 Team, SSC, "The YOG has left Singaporeans with a legacy of upgraded public sports facilities. This will benefit the larger community as Singaporeans can enjoy an enhanced sporting experience for themselves and their families at these public facilities."

3. The Tampines Bike Park will remain closed to the public for safety reasons, pending the evaluation of a proposal from the Singapore Amateur Cycling Association (SACA) to operate the facility. The Bishan Sports Hall and Bishan ClubFITT Gym will also remain closed while they undergo reinstatement and renovation works respectively. They are expected to reopen on 11 and 29 October 2010 respectively.

4. "The legacy of the YOG includes public sports venues of rigorous competition standards. This will benefit our local sports fraternity as it will provide an enhanced training and sporting experience for our athletes. More than that, the YOG has propelled Singapore onto the map as a premier venue for world-class sporting events. We are confident that sports events organisers will be drawn to hold regional and world-class sports events in Singapore, thus livening up the Singapore sports scene," added Mr Fan.

5. A few highly anticipated sporting events which will be held in Singapore over the next few months include the ASEAN Basketball League from 3 October to February 2011 to be held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, the FINA/ARENA Swimming World Cup 2010 Series (Singapore leg) from 16 to 17 October to be held at the Singapore Sports School, 3rd World Junior Wushu Championship 2010 from 2 to 10 December at the Jurong East Sports and Cultural Centre, the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore on 5 December and the Li Ning Singapore Youth International from 13 to 19 December 2010 which will take place at the Yio Chu Kang Sports Hall.

**About Singapore Sports Council**<br>
Formed in 1973, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is tasked with developing a holistic sports culture for the nation. The SSC creates opportunities for people to excel in sports; opportunities for people to be engaged in sports as, coaches, officials, volunteers or fans; and opportunities for people to do business in sports as sponsors and investors. The SSC has changed the way Singaporeans view and participate in sports. Through sports, we now have an enhanced national identity thanks to our sports participation programmes; greater national pride as a result of high performance results at international and regional games; and more diversified economic stability through our vibrant sports industry initiatives.
