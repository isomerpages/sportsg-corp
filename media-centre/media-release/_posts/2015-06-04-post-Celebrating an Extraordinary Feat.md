### **Celebrating an Extraordinary Feat**

To celebrate the extraordinary feat that ultramarathoners Yong Yuen Cheng, 43 and Lim Nghee Huat, 61 have achieved in their Go50 mission to run 50km consecutively for 50 days, the duo have been accorded the honour of kindling the official Southeast Asian (SEA) Games flame.

Upon completing their last 50km run today at The Promontory @ Marina Bay, the ultramarathoners ignited the official flame using the sun’s rays, reflected on a large parabolic mirror. The flame was kept in a safety lantern for use in tonight’s Torch Parade.

“It is a great honour to kindle the official flame for the 28th SEA Games. I am just an ordinary person, but I represent my follow Singaporeans in kindling the flame and I wish all the best to our Team Singapore athletes!” said Yong Yuen Cheng.

The Torch Parade this evening will mark the culmination of all community engagement programmes leading up to the Games. Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth will be present to witness the completion of the final public art installation under the Torch Up! programme – an effort that was conceived to bring the 28th SEA Games closer to the masses through a series of art, community and lifestyle initiatives. Minister Wong will then light up the 28th SEA Games Torch which will thereafter be paraded around Marina Bay – starting from The Promontory @ Marina Bay and ending at Marina Bay Sands Event Plaza, passing by iconic landmarks like Merlion Park, the Esplanade and Helix Bridge.

Members of the public are invited to come down to The Promontory @ Marina Bay to be part of the final Torch Up! before the official opening of the Games on 5 June. There will be a carnival, stage performances and a whole array of activities at the venue from 3pm onwards. The ceremony will kick off at 5.30pm.
