Commenting on this, Dr Tan said, "Not only are we sending the largest Olympic contingent in 52 years, this is also the best-prepared team going into the Olympic games. We came so close to bringing home a medal in 2004, so expectations on Team Singapore this year will be high. Many of our athletes have improved tremendously in the last few years and I am confident Team Singapore will give their very best at the Games."
