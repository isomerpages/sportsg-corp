This year's contingent is the largest since its representation at the Melbourne Games in 1956. Commenting on this, Dr Tan said, "Not only are we sending the largest Olympic contingent in 52 years, this is also the best-prepared team going into the Olympic games. We came so close to bringing home a medal in 2004, so expectations on Team Singapore this year will be high. Many of our athletes have improved tremendously in the last few years and I am confident Team Singapore will give their very best at the Games."
