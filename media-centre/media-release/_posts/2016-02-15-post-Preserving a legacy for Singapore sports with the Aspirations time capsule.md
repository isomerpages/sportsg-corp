### **Preserving a legacy for Singapore sports with the Aspirations time capsule**

A time capsule containing 50 items that are symbolic of our nation’s sporting aspirations will be officially sealed and laid to rest; thereby preserving a legacy for Singapore sports. Named “Aspirations” time capsule, the 1.4m by 1.4m by 1.4m steel capsule will be located at the Waterfront of the Singapore Sports Hub and will be reopened after 25 years.  
  
Says Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, Sport Singapore, “The time capsule reflects our belief in Singapore’s youth. As we look towards the next 25 years with a view towards SG Future, it is how we strive to live better through sport that will take us forward with each new generation. And it is with grit, strength and determination that each generation will quietly keep the Singapore spirit burning bright.”

**Items that tell the story of our hopes and dreams**

Previously symbolically sealed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to commemorate the official opening of the Singapore Sports Hub at "Youth Celebrate!" in July 2015, the selected items are specially chosen to reflect the aspirations of Youth and sport in Singapore – Sports excellence to inspire the next generation, providing opportunities through sport that will bond the community while encouraging them to stay active, and a caring and cohesive society where everyone will have the opportunity to participate in the sport of their choice.  
  
Amongst the items include a replica of the laurel that was presented to Team Singapore swimmer Yip Pin Xiu when she was inducted into the Hall of Fame, a resistance buoy designed by Colin Schooling and used by Joseph Schooling in his early training, a football given out at the 2013 Canon Lion City Cup that is signed by the football players from Saturday Night Lights - a programme organised by the SportCares Foundation, a book of aspirations by students of the Singapore Sports School and a framed copy of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s speech at "Youth Celebrate!".  
  
Adds Mr Seow, “We selected meaningful items that would allow future generations of Singaporeans to better appreciate our past achievements and to celebrate the progress that we will be making in the next 25 years for Singapore sports. I urge all Singaporeans to return for that date so that this will not become a forgotten piece of history but a living gallery that allows us to reaffirm our commitment to each other and to future generations to come.”  
  
Says Team Singapore shooter Martina Veloso, who contributed a visor and glove, “I feel honoured to be one of those chosen to contribute some items to the time capsule. I selected these as it was one of my very first few visors and gloves, so it means a lot to me. My hope for aspiring sportsmen and women is to remind them to never give up, no matter how tough it gets.”  
  
Team Singapore swimmer Zachary Ian Tan, who contributed a 400m individual medley medal says, “This is one of the medals that I won in the 2015 Singapore National Age-Group (Juniors) in which I competed in, and where I broke the Age Group records in all the 12 events. That was a very significant moment of my swimming career. To be selected to contribute an item among the other well-known athletes shows that I am developing in the right direction. This will also keep me focused on my dreams and aspirations to be an Olympic athlete in the future.”
