### **Two-Year Ban For Silat Exponent Saiedah Said**

**Singapore, 5 June 2013** - Silat exponent Saiedah Bte Said has tested positive for the banned substances Nor-Sibutramine and OH-Nor Sibutramine (Metabolites of Sibutramine) under the 2013 Prohibited List following in-competition testing at the 38th National Pencak Silat Championships on 14 April 2013.

2. The 28-year-old was informed by Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) that she may have committed a possible Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) on 21 May 2013. She requested for her 'B' sample to be analysed which subsequently confirmed her 'A' sample result.

3. The National Anti-Doping Disciplinary Committee (NADC), appointed by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), convened yesterday (4 June 2013) to deliberate on the case.

4. Following the meeting, the NADC has imposed a Two-Year ban on Saiedah. She is ineligible to participate, as an athlete or support personnel, in any sport during the period of the ban. She is also disqualified from the 38th National Pencak Silat Championships and all results, medals, points and prizes attained at the event are forfeited.

5. Under the ADS Anti-Doping Rules, Singapore Silat Federation is required to enforce the sanctions on Saiedah immediately. She has until 17 June 2013 to submit an appeal to the National Anti-Doping Appeals Committee (NAAC).

6. Said Ms Yeo Say Po, Deputy Director of ADS, "Under the World Anti-Doping Code, the rule of strict liability states that it is ultimately the athlete's sole responsibility to ensure that anything that they ingest does not contain any prohibited substance. This case is a reminder to all athletes to be always mindful of what they consume to avoid falling foul of any anti-doping rule violation."
