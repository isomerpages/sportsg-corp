### **Tickets to all 28th SEA Games sports now available following conclusion of official team draws**

With the last official team draw for the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games having concluded on 30 April 2015, fixtures for all sports have been finalised and tickets for Basketball and Football will be on sale from tomorrow, 6 May 2015 at 10am.

The final of team draws was conducted for Basketball during the 11th Southeast Asia Basketball Association (“SEABA”) Men’s Basketball Championship on Thursday. It was conducted by stakeholders of the sports community and supervised by Secretary General of Southeast Asia Basketball Association, Dato' Yeoh Choo Hock, in the presence of Singapore SEA Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) officials. With seven out of the nine participating countries for Basketball (Men’s) for the 28th SEA Games already seeded based on the results of the 27th SEA Games, the draw was conducted for Timor Leste and Vietnam to be drawn into either Group A or Group B.

The results of the draw are as follows:

| **Group A** | **Group B** |
| -------- | -------- |
| Philippines | Thailand |
| Malaysia | Singapore |
| Indonesia | Cambodia |
| Timor Leste | Myanmar |
|  | Vietnam |

The grouping pulled up results that will blow the bleachers at the Games. Within Group A, 16-time SEA Games Gold Medalist, Philippines is set to play against Malaysia on 11 June 2015. Team Malaysia is the only other team in the history of SEA Games to have clinched the gold in Basketball since the sport was introduced to the Games in 1977.

For Women’s Basketball, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore will be playing each other in a round robin format.

The fixtures for football have also called out some very interesting draws, with hosts Singapore playing 2013 SEA Games runners up Indonesia on 11 June 2015, and 2013 SEA Games Gold Medalist Thailand playing Malaysia on 4 June 2015.
