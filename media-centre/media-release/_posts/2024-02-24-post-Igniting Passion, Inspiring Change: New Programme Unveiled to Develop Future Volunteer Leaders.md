<p><strong>Singapore, 24 February 2024 </strong>– Team Nila, Sport Singapore’s
volunteer force held its annual awards ceremony today, recognising 397
outstanding volunteers who have earned the Gold, Silver and Bronze awards
<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>in recognition of their contribution and commitment in 2023. This
is up from 305 awards given out in 2022, with the main increase in the
Bronze category, signifying more volunteers coming forward to give back
through sport. In 2023, about 5,500 Team Nila volunteers contributed close
to 150,000 hours across 126 sporting and community events. These sport
volunteers provided operational support at major sporting events and assisted
with selected ActiveSG sport centre programmes. Our sport volunteers supported
the National Day Parade (NDP) 2023 show segment and marching contingent,
as well as assisted with the NDP air safety teams and was the key workforce
at the National Day Heartland Festivals at five sites across Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>New Leadership Programme for Team Nila Volunteers </strong>
<br>Sport Singapore announced a new leadership programme to identify and groom
potential Team Nila volunteer leaders. The programme will provide training
to equip suitable volunteers with the essential skills and competencies
needed for effective leadership. These potential leaders will focus on
confidence building and be trained to excel and to lead in functions such
as sport competition management, event logistics and manpower coordination.
This is to develop leaders who are competent and confident in rallying
and managing effective volunteer teams. The training combines a blend of
e-learning and in-person workshops to develop vibrant groups of empowered
Team Nila leaders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The introduction of the leadership programme is timely, with the increased
number of major sport events announced, including the World Aquatics Championship
in 2025, the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and ASEAN Para Games in 2029,
which will require support from sport volunteers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, a new Team Nila Volunteer Training Roadmap was also announced,
aimed at equipping all volunteers with the necessary skills set for a diverse
range of deployment opportunities. The comprehensive training includes
online and in-person sessions that emphasise functional and technical skills,
as well as collaborations with partners such as the SGSecure Programme
Office and the Singapore Civil Defence Force for the Responders Plus Programme
and the Red Cross Academy for Psychological First Aid. Upon completion,
volunteers will receive certificates, recognising their commitment to skills
development and basic ability to respond and assist to emergencies whilst
on duty.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Roaring with Pride with Team Nila Beats and New Team Nila Apparel </strong>
<br>In 2023, members of Team Nila cheered Team Singapore athletes to victory
at the SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia, and at the World Cup
2026 Qualifiers where our Lions took on Guam and Thailand. Members of the
Team Nila cheer squad played a vital role in creating a rousing home ground
atmosphere for Team Singapore athletes.
<br>
<br>In supporting our athletes,<strong> ‘Team Nila Beats’</strong>, a volunteer-led
cheering squad was formed as the heartbeat of Team Singapore. Team Nila
Beats will rally Singaporeans to unite and passionately cheer on Team Singapore
athletes towards success. Members will undergo training and cheering practices
to create a lively and positive ambience at selected Major Games and competitions
featuring Team Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Guest-of-Honour, Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth
and Second Minister for Law commended Team Nila volunteers’ commitment
to give back: “Team Nila brings people from all walks of life together,
united by a common passion for sports and the desire to serve the community.
Our volunteers not only give their time and energy, but also their commitment
and dedication in supporting sports activities in our communities. Their
resounding cheers at competitions and matches motivates our athletes to
go stronger and reach further. With the new leadership programme and training
roadmap, as well as more organised cheerleading efforts, I believe our
volunteers will continue to grow and make a greater impact on our sporting
scene. My heartfelt congratulations to all the award winners!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the Awards event, Team Nila unveiled revitalised uniforms and apparel.
The new line will enhance identity, through a standardised volunteer t-shirt
design as well as practical apparel items, suitable for use during volunteering
activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Team Nila has seen incredible growth over the years, and the suite of
new training programmes is an effective way for Sport Singapore to ensure
all volunteers have the knowledge and practical skills to support the major
games Singapore will be hosting, such as the World Aquatics Championships
in 2025. To further strengthen the Team Nila identity, we introduced a
new uniform featuring a lion emblem symbolising national pride, courage
and resilience, values upheld by both our Team Singapore athletes and by
Team Nila volunteers”, shared Mr Tan Hock Leong, Chief ActiveSG, Sport
Singapore.</p>

team leader who volunteered an astounding 525 hours combined. Bronze recipient
Sim Shi Dian Pearly, a full-time teacher was recognised for her dedication,
achieving close to 100 volunteering hours on the weekends. Ms Pearly constantly

give back to the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mdm Rohaniah Mohamed, a 63-year-old Team Nila silver champion is always
on the lookout for new volunteering opportunities. She maintains a young-at-heart
philosophy and participated in the NDP cycling show segment contingent
in 2023. This year, she put her hand up to rally Singaporeans to cheer
on Team Singapore with Team Nila Beats.&nbsp; Mr Vijaikumar s/o Rangabashayam,
