### **Largest And Strongest Field Of Elite Runners To Compete As SCMS Aims For IAAF Gold Label Status**

**Singapore, 2 December 2011** - This year's Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) will feature an impressive contingent of elite athletes, which includes some of the highest ranked marathon runners in the world alongside last year's race champions. Tweaks have also been made to enhance the race experience for all participants, as the organiser, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), works towards achieving the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Gold Label certification for the event.

2. "Elite athletes are a unique asset to any race and we are delighted to have in our midst a strong and diverse field of world-class runners who will undoubtedly add to the spectacle of this year's Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore. Their keen participation is testament to the efforts we have put into creating an attractive elite race, not just in terms of the prize money offered, but also a great race experience," said Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, SSC and Chairman, SCMS 2011 Organising Committee.

##### **Largest and Strongest Field of Elite Athletes to Date**

3. The SCMS 2011 will see a total of 26 international elite athletes from five different countries taking part in the Full Marathon race category. Participants from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Russia and Ukraine will start their race alongside 20,000 Full Marathon and Ekiden runners under the Christmas lights at Orchard Road.

4. With US$50,000 as the top prize for the men's and women's open categories for the Full Marathon, fierce competition will ensue among these top international athletes, of which 14 of them are IAAF-certified Gold level elite runners.

5. One of the frontrunners to clinch the men's title this year is Jackson Kipkoech Kotut, who achieved top spots in the Tiberias Marathon (2009) and Barcelona Marathon (2010). Last year's Barcelona Marathon saw the Kenyan run a personal best of 2:07:30 to secure victory in record-breaking fashion.

6. Providing stiff competition for Kotut will be his counterparts Kenneth Mburu Mungara and Thomson Kibet Cherogony, both of whom stormed into first and second places at the SCMS 2010 respectively. Other contenders for the title include Ben Kipruto Chebet of Kenya and Yared Dagnaw Sharew of Eritrea, both of whom will be competing in the SCMS for the first time.

7. This year's SCMS will also welcome back Kenyan favourite and 2010 winner, Irene Jerotich Koskei, who will be expected to defend her title in the women's open category once again. Twice the winner of the Nairobi Marathon in 2006 and 2009, Koskei has since enjoyed a formidable few seasons with a respectable 2:31:29 in the Daegu Marathon earlier this year.

8. Looking to usurp Koskei's throne will be Russian veteran Silviia Skvortsova, who will be looking to replicate her recent impressive time of 2:27:51 in the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in October this year. Other notable runners in the women's open category include Yuliya Ruban and Kateryna Stetsenko of Ukraine.

**Application for the IAAF Gold Label Certification**

9. To secure international recognition of the SCMS, efforts have been undertaken by SSC to register the Marathon for an IAAF Gold Label certification. Achieving the Gold Label status would put Singapore's marquee running event alongside the likes of the New York, Beijing, Tokyo, Berlin and London Marathon, and affirm its reputation as one of the greatest races in the world.

10. "Applying for the IAAF Gold Label certification for the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore underscores our ambition to become Asia's pinnacle race. With this certification, it will definitely help to boost our efforts in continuing to build on the race's strong following locally and in the region," added Mr Lim.

11. Some of the requirements specified by the IAAF for the Gold Label certification, which have been met by the organiser, include: a giant video screen on-site broadcasting the race; an international field of runners with a minimum number of men and women elite runners with specified race finishing times; doping controls; a well-equipped media centre with features such as live feed of the race and results; and full television coverage of the race in at least five different countries and international broadcasters distributing race coverage.

**Key Broadcast Profiles**

12. In line with the theme for this year's race - 'Run for a Reason', eight participants of the SCMS 2011 will be featured on television, each with their own interesting reasons and motivations for participation. Amongst these participants are last year's race winners - Kenneth Mburu Mungara and Irene Jerotich Koskei, local athletes Ashley Liew and Sumiko Tan, and four runners from various walks of life with inspirational stories to share.

13. These short featurettes will be shown regularly from now till race day on StarHub's complimentary sports channel SuperSports Arena (Starhub TV Channel 201). In addition, these runners will be interviewed during the 'live' broadcast of the race from 4.30am to 10.00am on the same channel. There will be a same day telecast of the race from 7.00pm to 12.30am. Race coverage will also be shown 'live' on SingaporeSports.tv from 4.30am to 10.00am.

**Supporters' Activities**

14.  As part of SSC's continuous efforts to engage the non-running community in Singapore's marquee running event, a slew of fun activities have also been planned for spectators and supporters. The public can expect to be entertained with 'live' band performances, jugglers and roving percussion drum squads. A free shuttle service for supporters will also bring them to the best viewing spots along the route.

15. The SCMS 2011 will see 65,000 runners participating in a variety of race categories which include the Full Marathon, Half Marathon, 10km and 5km Fun Run. Featuring three different routes, runners will take in the full spectrum of iconic landmarks in Singapore including Orchard Road, Chinatown, Universal Studios Singapore, Sentosa, Singapore Flyer and the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay.
