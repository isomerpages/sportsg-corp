### **Singapore-Johor Second Link Bridge Walk Returns For Its Ninth Edition to 5000 Brisk-Walkers**

**Singapore, 22 November 2009** - Close to 5000 brisk-walkers had the rare opportunity today to have their morning walk at the Second Link Bridge in the ninth installment of the Singapore-Johor Second Link Bridge Walk 2009. The event aims to promote community bonding through a mass-participation sporting activity such as brisk-walking. The event was also a platform for Singapore to forge closer bilateral ties with Johor.

2. Guest of Honour Dr Amy Khor, Mayor, South West District and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, together with special guest Mr Hoo Seong Chang, Chairman, Johor Tourism and Trade Committee, flagged off the walk from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim in Tuas. The 4-km loop walk took brisk-walkers from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, through the Tuas Checkpoint before heading onto the Second Link Bridge.

3. Since its initiation in 2000, both countries have taken turns to organise the event, with Singapore playing host to this year's edition. "We are honoured to once again play host to the Singapore-Johor Second Link Bridge Walk 2009. An event such as this provides us with the opportunity to forge stronger bonds with our neighbouring country, Malaysia. This mass event also further emphasises the diverse roles that sports can play - it is not only an activity through which one can keep fit and healthy, it is also an excellent platform to bridge and enhance community and bilateral relations," commented Dr Bervyn Lee, Chairman, Singapore-Johor Second Link Bridge Walk 2009 Organising Committee and Senior Director, Sports Pathways Development, Singapore Sports Council.

4. Traditionally a competitive running event, this year's Singapore-Johor Second Link Bridge Walk has been evolved to involve participants from brisk-walking clubs all across Singapore in a non-competitive mass-participation brisk-walking event.

5. "With the recent establishment of the National Brisk Walking Clubs, we felt that it was apt that this year's edition of the Singapore-Johor Second Link Bridge Walk event features this increasingly popular activity. Brisk-walking is a low-barrier sporting activity - everyone can be a part of it and it can be done almost anywhere. In addition to promoting active lifestyle through sports, brisk-walking is also a form of social activity as it allows for mass participation and community-bonding," added Dr Lee.
