#### **Voting Commences For Singapore National Games 2012 Logo And Mascot**

Singapore, 26 March 2012 - The public can now vote for the logo and mascot designs for the inaugural Singapore National Games (SNG)! They can take part in an online public voting at SNG's official website: [singaporenationalgames.sg](singaporenationalgames.sg) from today till 8 April, and choose the SNG logo and mascot designs they like best.

2. The SNG is a community-based multi-sports competition jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), People's Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations, as well as 10 National Sports Associations (NSAs). Held once every two years, the SNG will offer sports enthusiasts of all ages an opportunity to be part of Singapore's exciting sporting landscape. The SNG 2012 will take place from 1 September to 9 September 2012, and community teams from 15 clusters will pit against each other in ten sports.

3. The SNG logo and mascot designs contest held in February 2012 saw some 35 logo and 16 mascot entries submitted from various design schools and tertiary institutions. After the first round of judging held in early March, four designs each for the logo and mascot were shortlisted. Commenting on the contest, Mr Ng Eng Soon, Co-Chair of the SNG 2012 Organising Committee said, "Judging from the number of submissions, the logo and mascot contest has served its purpose of engaging the community at large and getting them involved in SNG right from the start. It has definitely helped to create a sense of ownership among the young for the Games as most of the students didn't think twice about having to spend their school holidays working on the designs. We hope to see such involvement and support from the public throughout the Games."

4. Publicis Singapore, a leading advertising and communications company has been working closely with the SNG Organising Committee to manage the contest. The company's Creative Director, Robert Upton, who is also on the judging panel, said shortlisting the entries was no mean feat, "There was a lot of great thinking behind the entries both from art and design colleges. This made the judging process more challenging but the entries that came out on top definitely deserved it. I am eager to see which entry garners the most votes."

5. Students whose designs were shortlisted got a rare opportunity to be mentored by members of the Publicis Singapore's creative team. Yong Wen Yeu, a second year Graphic Design student at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, whose entry made it to the final round of judging recollects his experience, "I was pleasantly surprised when I got a call from Publicis Singapore and was told that I could attend a coaching session with their Creative Director Robert Upton. Mr Upton shared some insights on typography that helped to ensure the various components of my design complemented one another. It is not every day that design students get an opportunity to be supervised by people with industry knowledge. It was an enriching experience."

6. The winners of the logo and mascot contest will be announced on 15 April 2012 during the launch of the Community Games 2012 which serves as the qualifying round for SNG 2012. Participants with the winning designs will each receive $1,000 cash and an internship opportunity at Publicis Singapore.
