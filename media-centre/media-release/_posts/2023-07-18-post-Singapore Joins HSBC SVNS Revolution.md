**Singapore, 18 July 2023 –** Singapore has been confirmed as one of the eight iconic destinations to host HSBC SVNS, World Rugby’s revamped and rebranded global celebration of rugby sevens that was launched today.

With a bold ambition to supercharge rugby’s global reach and appeal by being more relevant and accessible to younger, leisure-hungry audiences, SVNS aims to deliver the ultimate in immersive experiences, a unique festival of sport, entertainment and culture set against stunning backdrops.

Starting from December 2023, SVNS festivals will provide the annual platform for the world’s best sevens athletes to shine with 12 men’s and women’s teams sharing a global stage at the same location.

Located in the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore is a thriving tropical metropolis with a robust calendar of unique experiences to suit every interest. The city is easy to get around to experience its vibrant events, festivals, and experiences that reflect our multi-cultural heritage, and feed diverse passions across the arts, history, food, music, shopping and sports.

For the latest information on tickets, fans should visit the [new SVNS.com](https://www.svns.com/en/events/singapore) to find out more.

**World Rugby Chief Executive Alan Gilpin said**: “We are excited to be launching HSBC SVNS, the supercharged new identity for our Olympic format, with iconic destinations and a new concept on and off the field, broadening the reach and appeal of the sport beyond its traditional audiences.  

“Our ambition is for SVNS to be at the forefront of our growth strategy, appealing to a younger, leisure-hungry audience. In eight iconic destinations played over seven months, we will bring together a truly immersive festival of rugby, music, food and experiences to create the ultimate weekend-long get together for young people, the hottest ticket and open a new era for the sport.  

“For the first time in rugby sevens history, all locations will be unified under the same approach, meaning that the overall experience is the same and we can optimise commercial revenue for reinvestment, including playing our part in ensuring that sevens is a viable career path for the talented players and Olympians.

“We are delighted to be extending our long-standing and impactful title partnership with HSBC. They share our passion to grow the sport in new nations and communities and have played an instrumental role in advancing the reach and success of the sport, particularly at the community game level. We are excited by the opportunity we have in front of us to work with HSBC to take SVNS to the next level.”

**Summer vibes, festival feel**

Off the field, SVNS is all about summertime vibes. Sun-soaked days and unique experiences as rugby, music, food, and wellbeing combine to attract a new generation of audiences. Celebrating cuisine and culture, each SVNS destination will showcase its unique local flavour, adding to the overall excitement and enjoyment of the events across the globe.  

There will also be a range of competitive and social sports for all at SVNS festivals, from non-contact rugby to functional fitness. Every event will deliver something unique.  

**New format, gender parity**

Each event is designed to enable the world’s top players to be at their best. Following consultation with players, fans, broadcasters and unions, the competition format has been revamped with SVNS set to deliver more adrenalin pumping action and drama.

The top eight teams, based on cumulative series points, at the conclusion of Singapore SVNS will secure their opportunity to compete in the new ‘winner takes all’ Grand Finals in Madrid, where the women’s and men’s SVNS champions will be crowned.  

Madrid will also play host to the high stakes relegation play-off competition where teams ranked ninth to 12th will join the top four teams from the World Rugby Sevens Challenger Series. The top four placed teams of this play-off will secure their place on next year's SVNS.  

Under the new model, SVNS delivers gender parity with all seven rounds and the Grand Final featuring combined men’s and women’s competitions and equal participation fees, with a 70 per cent uplift in World Rugby’s investment in participation fees as a commitment to sustainable growth.  

**Continuation of an impactful and innovative partnership with HSBC** 

Continuing 12 years of passionate support of rugby sevens, HSBC has been confirmed as SVNS title partner in a four-year deal. The renewal is a continuation of a hugely successful long-term partnership between HSBC and World Rugby that has created opportunities for players and fans all over the world. Alongside World Rugby, HSBC has been committed to the future of the women’s rugby and has helped 558,962 young people pick up a rugby ball through grassroots programmes. 

**HSBC Group Chief Executive, Noel Quinn said:** “Through many years of working closely with World Rugby to showcase and support the sport around the world, HSBC has become synonymous with the World Rugby Sevens. I’m particularly proud of the new opportunities that we have helped to open up by taking the sport into new markets, supporting the growth of the women’s game and giving tens of thousands of young people the chance to try rugby for the first time. I’m delighted that our hugely successful partnership with World Rugby will continue for years to come, and that HSBC will be able to help the sport reach even greater heights.”

**HSBC Ambassador and former USA 7s captain, Abby Gustaitis added:** “Having recently come to the end of my HSBC SVNS playing career, I am so delighted that the next generation of female sevens players will be part of a series that is completely equal in terms of schedule and pay. HSBC has been a huge supporter of the growth of the women’s game and today’s announcement is a huge step in making rugby a sport that is fully equal for all.”

Having hosted the annual series since 2002, Singapore is no stranger to the event and is looking forward to further elevating rugby to the local community and beyond.

**Sport Singapore, Chief Executive Officer, Alan Goh** said: “HSBC SVNS has grown to become a mainstay in Singapore’s sporting calendar. Over the past 10 editions, this tournament and its community activations have elevated the profile of rugby as a sport in Singapore and attracted both local and international fans to immerse in its festivities. As we continue our partnership with World Rugby, the 2024 HSBC SVNS Singapore will see the top women’s teams compete in our iconic National Stadium. We look forward to combining different elements of the signature Rugby Sevens experience to promote more interest in the sport and inspire our next generation of youth athletes.”

"We are proud to continue our support for the revamped HSBC SVNS series, forging a new era of supercharged rugby and festivities. In addition to the women's rugby sevens tournament which will be featured in Singapore for the first time, the inclusion of more family-friendly festivities and lifestyle programming builds on our “Family Sevens” strengths to welcome more local and overseas fans. This best-in-class event enhances Singapore's appeal as a leading leisure destination in the region and we look forward to welcoming the sport’s top players and their global fans next May," said **Melissa Ow, Chief Executive, Singapore Tourism Board**.

With the tournament set to return to the heart of Singapore Sports Hub, **Quek Swee Kuan, Chief Executive Officer, Kallang Alive Sport Management** says: “HSBC SVNS is a testament to Singapore Sports Hub's status as a destination of choice for sports. We have hosted this world-class competition at the Singapore Sports Hub since 2016 and look forward once again to celebrating the epic sport of rugby, on and off the field, with both men's and for the first time, women’s teams competing in the HSBC SVNS in Singapore. We are thrilled that we can continue to excite fans and rally communities by bringing the best of sport, entertainment and lifestyle to Singapore.”

**President of Singapore Rugby Union, Sunny Seah**, also expressed his anticipation for HSBC SVNS taking place in Singapore. He said, “Singapore being chosen again for another cycle is a tremendous testament for the excellence in enlarging the interest and advancing the potential of 7s and rugby in Singapore and throughout the region. The Singapore Rugby Union is delighted and proud to be part of the team to bring this event back in a different way and to continue to grow the game through developing community-based fringe events around the new HSBC SVNS.”

To mark the launch, a new ‘Destination SVNS’ campaign, has been unveiled celebrating the new, vibrant SVNS brand and positions SVNS as the ultimate summer style destination, packed with entertainment and immersive experiences from sunrise to sunset. 

The new series follows a widespread and comprehensive consultation process, involving representatives from participating teams, existing tournament hosts, the International Rugby Players, player welfare representatives and fans.
