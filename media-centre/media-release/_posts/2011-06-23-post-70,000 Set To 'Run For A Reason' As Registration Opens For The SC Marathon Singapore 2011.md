## **70,000 Set To 'Run For A Reason' As Registration Opens For The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2011**


*SSC Committed to Enhance Race Day Experience for Participants and Supporters Alike With Greater Race Engagement*

**Singapore, 23 June 2011** - The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) 2011 promises something for everyone - with greater race engagement, community involvement, and exciting experiences.

2. SCMS' organiser, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is increasing its efforts to enhance the race experience for runners this year, and is exploring ways to move the baggage collection point closer to the Padang from the F1 Pit building, heeding the feedback received by participants last year.

3. Further affirming the SCMS as the People's Race, the SSC is also looking to ease the congestion at the merging point of all three routes, ensuring a smoother and more seamless running experience for participants.

4. "The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore has become a signature event for our city. Given the roaring demand in 2010, we are increasing participation to 70,000 people with help from our title sponsor Standard Chartered Bank," said Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, SSC, and Chairman of the SCMS 2011 Organising Committee at the official launch of registration for SCMS 2011 at Raffles Place Park. "I also am delighted to continue working with Singapore Athletics Association on SCMS 2011. SAA shares our desire to see the SCMS become Asia's pinnacle race."

5. Guest-of-Honour Major General (NS) Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, was also present at the launch event to witness the commencement of registration for Singapore's favourite running event, which has increased its capacity to a record 70,000 participants this year.

6. Commenting on the event, Mr Ray Ferguson, Regional CEO, Singapore & Southeast Asia Standard Chartered Bank said, "The passion, courage, and determination of the runners each year resonate strongly with what we stand for as an organisation. Together in partnership with the SSC, we have created many reasons for Singaporeans to run; whether they are experienced marathoners trying to better their time or running to stay fit. The increase in the number of participants we expect this year is testimony to that."

**More Runners & Community Engagement Activities**

7. Apart from familiar features like the iconic routes through the heart of Singapore, a new 5km Fun Run has been introduced, probably making it the most inclusive Marathon in Singapore. The new 5km Fun Run will give Singaporeans more incentive to Run for a Reason, adding to the expansive range of 10km, 21km, 42km and Kids Dash race distances.

8. This year, increased engagement activities will be sustained from the launch event to race day, including training programmes, running clinics, and even kids camps for the young participants of the Kids Dash. In addition, during race day, various forms of exciting entertainment, activities and programs will be lined up along the three picturesque race routes, providing a comprehensive and fulfilling overall experience for participants.

9. Supporters and runners can look out for the introduction of drumming elements in all SCMS 2011 events including the five road shows leading up to race day. This is part of SSC's efforts to rally and excite the supporters turning up along race routes each year, as well as to drum up support for runners as they run towards the finishing line.

10. In addition, social media presence and interactivity, including a special YouTube channel, will be ramped up to better target the digital generation, as SCMS 2011 goes all out to touch the hearts and minds of Singaporeans across all walks of lives.

11. "With an increase in community engagement activities, the SSC is confident that the People's Race will continue to grow and play a vital role in helping to cultivate a vibrant sporting culture in Singapore. Said Mr Lim, "Sporting Singapore has always provided space for everyone who wants to play sports, and the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore personifies this philosophy of inclusivity."

12. The inaugural SCMS attracted a record 60,000 participants in 2010. For further details of the SCMS 2011, please visit [www.marathonsingapore.com](www.marathonsingapore.com) and [www.facebook.com/marathonSG](www.facebook.com/marathonSG).
