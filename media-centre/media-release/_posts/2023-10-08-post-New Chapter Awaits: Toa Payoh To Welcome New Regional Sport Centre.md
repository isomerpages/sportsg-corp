**Singapore, 8 October 2023** – Toa Payoh Sport Centre will close on 31 October 2023 to make way for the construction of a new Regional Sport Centre, as part of the Toa Payoh Integrated Development project (TPID). The 12-hectare Toa Payoh Integrated Development will be home to a state-of-the-art Regional Sport Centre, a Polyclinic, a Library, and a Regional Town Park. The project is expected to be completed by 2030 under the Sport Facilities Master Plan, which is a key initiative of the national sport blueprint, Vision 2030.

The new Integrated development is part of Sport Singapore’s (SportSG) efforts to bring more quality sporting infrastructure closer to the community and encourage citizens to be more physically active while enjoying convenient access to health and wellness facilities and programmes.


Post closure, residents may still continue their fitness programmes and sporting activities at other available sporting locations. As part of a transition plan that started earlier this year, other ActiveSG Sport Centres such as Bishan and Jalan Besar will support residents, instructors, athletes, and coaches from Toa Payoh Sport Centre with alternative facilities.

“The new Regional Sport Centre marks a milestone in our efforts to bring high-quality sport facilities to the public. The demand for sport and physical activities is growing. The National Sport Participation Survey has shown a 20% increase in regular sport and physical activity participation from 2015 to 2022. We want to continue to support the health and fitness goals of the community and conducive facilities play a key role. As part of our commitment to ensure that residents and the sporting fraternity continue to enjoy sport and exercise, as well as train during this period, we have been, and will continue to support them with customised transition plans to ensure minimal disruptions,” said **Mr Tan Hock Leong, Chief, ActiveSG, Sport Singapore**.

A closure event was held at the Toa Payoh Sport Centre on 8 October for residents to come together to commemorate the centre’s rich sporting heritage. **Advisors to Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC and Marymount SMC - Mr Chee Hong Tat, Acting Minister for Transport, Ms Gan Siow Huang, Minister of State for Education &amp; Manpower, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Chong Kee Hiong** - were also present at the event to take part in the sporting activities and engage with some 1000 residents.

**Mr Chee Hong Tat, Acting Minister for Transport and Grassroots Adviser to Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC** said, “The Toa Payoh Integrated Development (TPID) is an example of how we constantly rejuvenate and improve our town, to improve the living environment for residents. When the TPID is completed by 2030, residents can enjoy better sport facilities, a renewed Toa Payoh Town Park, as well as a redeveloped polyclinic and bigger library. I am grateful to our
agencies and partners for working with us to turn this vision into reality, and I thank our residents for sharing their feedback and suggestions.”

Toa Payoh resident Mr Ace Liew said, “I am excited about the TPID project. I believe the new development will be a common space for families and residents to come together to foster a healthier and more connected community. With the other amenities all within one location, my family will be able to enjoy convenient access to exercise, nature, and healthcare. My family is now taking active steps to incorporate more healthy lifestyle habits, and we are looking forward to starting an exercise routine and enjoying quality family time together.”
