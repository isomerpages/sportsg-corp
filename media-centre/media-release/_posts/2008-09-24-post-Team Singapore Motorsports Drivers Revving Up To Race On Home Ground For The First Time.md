### **Team Singapore Motorsports Drivers Revving Up To Race On Home Ground For The First Time**

Three Team Singapore Drivers To Take Part In Formula One Singtel Singapore Grand Prix Support Races

Singaporeans can look forward to cheer on the nation's homegrown racing talents at the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia and Aston Martin Asia Cup, support races for the upcoming Formula One Singtel Singapore Grand Prix, the world's first night race. Three Team Singapore motorsports drivers, Melvin Choo, Ringo Chong and Hafiz Koh, will be taking part in the races that will be happening from 26 to 28 September 2008.

The trio is all set to fire up the tracks on home-ground for the first time. Ringo and Melvin will be taking part in both the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia and Aston Martin Asia Cup, while Hafiz will be joining his fellow Team Singapore drivers for the latter race.

"This is the first time that our Team Singapore drivers will be racing on their home turf, so let's rally behind them and cheer them on as they look towards creating a name for Singapore in the motor sports arena. As part of the Singapore Sports Council's 'Let's Play' movement, we are encouraging everyone in Singapore to be involved in sports in all ways - be it as a participant, a supporter or a spectator at all times simply because they enjoy it. So, we are calling out to all Singaporeans to be part of this momentous event by rooting for our very own motorsport drivers as they race for a spot on the podium at the support races of Singapore's very first Formula One race!," said Dr Bervyn Lee, Director, Sports Culture Division, Singapore Sports Council.

Two Team Singapore drivers, Ringo and Melvin will be racing in the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, the region's premier sportscar series. Currently ranked 10th and 12th after 8 rounds, Melvin and Ringo hope to complete their inaugural race on home ground with a podium finish. For Ringo, this will be his second time participating in the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, while Melvin, an Asian Touring Car Series driver, is taking part in the race series for the first time. Ringo had previously participated in the race in 2004, where he finished 7th overall in the championship and was one of the top Asian drivers in the league.

All three Team Singapore drivers, Melvin, Ringo and Hafiz will take to the tracks for the Aston Martin Asia Cup, which will see drivers from Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Australia and Singapore race for the coveted spot on the podium. Melvin, currently ranked 4th after 6 rounds, is looking towards echoing his performance in Sepang, where he took his first win of the season. Also aiming for a podium finish are fellow Team Singapore drivers Ringo, who is looking at improving his standing in this round, and Hafiz, who is making his debut in the Aston Martin race scene in this leg.
