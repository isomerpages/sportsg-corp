<p><strong>Singapore, 12 June 2024 - </strong>The Li Foundation has renewed
its support for the SportCares – Li Foundation Multi Sport Programme (SLFMSP)
for five more years and solidified this partnership with a S$500,000 donation.
This amount is the foundation’s largest contribution to SportCares to date
and will be matched dollar for dollar by the One Team Singapore Fund. In
commemoration of the renewed partnership, the inaugural SportCares - Li
Foundation Triathlon took place today, bringing together close to 200 children
and youth participants from three community partners to the Singapore Sports
Hub.</p>
<p>SportCares partnered Li Foundation to kickstart the SLFMSP in 2019, with
the aim of improving overall fitness and achieving better developmental
outcomes through sport participation. Since then, the programme grew from
a pioneer batch of 64 youths to over 500 participants (as at 1 June 2024).
The SLFMSP also recently expanded its outreach to include youths with special
needs from MIJ Hub.</p>
<p>Building on this growth momentum, the SportCares – Li Foundation Triathlon
was introduced for the first time this year to expose youths to the three
sport components of a triathlon (swim, cycle and run). The event followed
the success of the Li Foundation Duathlon as swim training sessions resumed
post-pandemic. Mr Lionel Li, Chairman of Li Foundation and Mr Marcus Tan,
Chief of Sport Development Group, Sport Singapore, flagged off the event
today at Singapore Sports Hub’s 100PLUS Promenade (duathlon) and OCBC Aquatic
Centre (triathlon). The event drew close to 200 participants, including
first timers such as children from 7oaks Student Care under the triathlon
category, as well as youths with special needs from the MIJ Hub and students
from NorthLight School under the duathlon category. <strong>(Refer to Annex A for information on race the categories)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Sport Singapore is very grateful to the Li Foundation for its ongoing
partnership with SportCares. Since 2019, the SportCares-Li Foundation Multi-Sport
Programme has enabled over 500 children and youths from vulnerable backgrounds
to learn new sports. With this continued support, our programme will be
able to empower more youths to realise their potential in life through
sport participation and ‘<em>live better through sport</em>’,” said <strong>Mr Alan Goh, Chief Executive Officer, Sport Singapore</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the lead up to the race, participants from the SLFMSP attended weekly
training sessions under the expert guidance of SportCares coaches. Apart
from being exposed to the basic techniques of swimming, cycling and running,
they also underwent endurance training and learnt how to transition properly
and safely between the three legs of swim, bike and run.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My passion for long-distance running and endurance races extends beyond
just health benefits; it encompasses the values of resilience and perseverance
that I believe our youth can learn and apply in their lives. Through our
partnership with SportCares, we hope to continue equipping the youth with
pathways to achieve their full potential in sports and beyond. I am delighted
to announce Li Foundation’s sponsorship of S$500,000 to SportCares this
year, our largest contribution to date. I hope these funds will enable
SportCares to expand the program, reaching out to more youths and fostering
their passion for excellence through sport.” said <strong>Mr Lionel Li, Chairman, Li Foundation.</strong>

<p><strong>Quotes from Triathlon Participants</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I am very grateful to be part of the SportCares – Li Foundation Multisport Programme because it teaches me not to give up and stay resilient. I used to have scoliosis and had to undergo surgery. Although I am fully healed now, there was a time when the future felt very uncertain. I missed many lessons in school and wasn't sure if I would be able to participate in physical activities again. With the support of my family, friends and the SportCares – Li Foundation Multisport Programme, my recovery journey was significantly smoother, and I was able to pick myself up. I hope to carry forward this spirit of support and continue helping others who are on a similar path.” ~ </em><strong>Ms. Noor Aisyah Binte Muhammed Nassir, 16 year old student from NorthLight School</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>“Three years ago, I was diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy. I wore masks to hide my condition and I was living in constant fear that this would last forever. However, I refused to let my medical condition prevent me from becoming the best version of myself and sought treatment. To aid with my recovery journey, I wanted to stay active through trying different kinds of sports and I am thankful to SportCares – Li Foundation Multisport Programme for providing me with that opportunity. Training for today’s Triathlon was not easy, but the process reminded me that the tough times that we face will eventually get better and pay off. As the saying goes: Pressure turns rough stones into gems. I hope that nobody gives up on their dreams and perseveres beyond the hardships to watch their dreams turn into a reality.” ~ </em><strong>Ms. Yusrina Kamila binte Suhaidi, 12 year old member of 7oaks Student Care @ Jurong</strong>

</p>
<p><strong>Quotes from Multi-Sport Coaches</strong>
</p>
<p><em>"When these young participants first trained, many were unsure of their abilities and lacked confidence. But through regular training for the race, I've witnessed a transformation in them. Their bodies have become stronger and for some, their minds have focused, pushing through the workouts. For many of the youth, self-doubt has given way to the belief that they can complete the race, definitely important life lessons for them.” </em>~ <strong>Mr Sunny Gan, 57 year old, SportCares Multi-Sport Coach</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“Our young participants have come a long way – they have shown determination and for the older children, an appreciation of the training journey. This is not uncommon in the sport of triathlon where participants train to overcome tiredness and build mental toughness. I am honoured to guide them along and see their growth."</em> ~ <strong>Ms Marinna Masjudi, 50 year old, SportCares Multi-Sport Coach</strong>
