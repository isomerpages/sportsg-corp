### **Singapore Sports Council's Oon Steps Down**

**Singapore, 8 October 2010** - The Singapore Sports Council announced today that Chief Executive Officer Oon Jin Teik will be leaving the organisation to return to the private sector. His last day at SSC will 31 December 2010.

2. Oon will be joining the senior management team of Hyflux Ltd as Group Executive Vice President (Business Development) and will report to Founder/ Group Chief Executive Officer Olivia Lum.

3. Said Minister for Community Development Youth & Sports Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, "I am always very happy to witness the career advancement of colleagues who have served with excellence in their current appointments. Jin Teik has played an invaluable role in the transformation of the Singapore sports scene over the past 6 years. However, our loss will be the gain of the private sector. Jin Teik discussed this new opportunity with me some time ago, and I encouraged him to pursue this avenue with our blessings. In his usual responsible manner, he waited until the Sports Hub project achieved financial close and the YOG transition was well underway. We are very grateful to him. I wish him all the very best for the future."

4. Richard Seow, Chairman of the Singapore Sports Council added, "In the area of sports excellence, Jin Teik has institutionalised a systematic sports delivery system with a pathway to elite performance that will ensure sustained competitive excellence in the long run. This has enabled Singapore to deliver historic best performances at the last few major multi sports and many world championships."

5. Former SSC Chairman Alex Chan, who recently stepped down, added "In addition to SSC's achievements in sports excellence and sports infrastructure, Jin Teik has laid the foundation for the growth of a burgeoning sports industry in Singapore. We now have in place the basic building blocks to grow the industry. This includes a sports industry manpower development strategy and partnerships with education institutions; a credible sports broadcast roadmap and plans; a comprehensive long term sports events blueprint supported by a vibrant international and local sports events scene; a growing sports sponsorship market; as well as major upcoming mega sports projects such as the Sports Hub and Changi Motorsports Hub."

6. A former Olympian (member of Singapore swim team at 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles) and a chemical engineer by training, Oon holds a Bachelor in Chemical Engineering and a Master in Business Administration in General Management from Brigham Young University, Utah, USA. He has attended management courses at the Wharton Business School, Kellogg Business School, DuPont's Leadership and Management Programme, and the Singapore government's Leadership & Management Programme (LAP).
