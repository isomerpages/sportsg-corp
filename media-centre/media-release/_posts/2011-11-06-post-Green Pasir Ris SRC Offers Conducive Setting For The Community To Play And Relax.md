### **'Green' Pasir Ris SRC Offers Conducive Setting For The Community To Play And Relax**
 
Singapore, 6 November 2011 - Pasir Ris Sports and Recreation Centre (SRC), Singapore Sports Council's (SSC) newest addition to its family of 21 SRCs, features a comprehensive range of sports facilities with a diverse retail mix to provide an all rounded experience for guests.

2.  Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean graced the official opening of Pasir Ris SRC this morning along with Mr Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Members of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC and Punggol East SMC, as well as Government Parliamentary Committee member for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Mr Vikram Nair. They were joined by grassroot leaders and fellow residents as they celebrated the launch of their new 'playground'.

3. "Pasir Ris Sports and Recreation Centre has well integrated sports and lifestyle facilities. Our residents can now enjoy a sporting and healthy lifestyle while relaxing and building bonds with family and friends. Our residents have long wanted such a centre in Pasir Ris, and are all delighted at these wonderful new facilities," said DPM Teo who is also the Coordinating Minister for National Security, Minister for Home Affairs, and Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

4. The SRC offers modern sports facilities which are refreshingly different from conventional types, such as a swimming complex with water play features and a Jacuzzi, a gymnasium with pool view, an air-conditioned sports hall with seating capacity for 2,000 spectators, and a 5-a-side soccer court. A wide variety of lifestyle amenities is also offered at this SRC ranging from sporting apparel shops and F&B outlets, to a child education centre and 24-hour convenience store.

5.  Since its soft opening on 18 July this year, Pasir Ris SRC has seen encouraging utilisation figures for its sports facilities. Pasir Ris Swimming Complex has recorded an average monthly attendance of more than 20,000 visitors, while its ClubFITT Gymnasium attracted an average of 11,000 visitors per month.

6. "The Singapore Sports Council wants to see more Singaporeans playing more sports and living healthier lives. Through enhanced sporting facilities and programmes, our SRCs are evolving with the changing needs of our community. Singaporeans need vibrant sports and leisure spaces where they can relax, get fit and socialise with family and friends," said Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, SSC.

7. Pasir Ris SRC is also thoughtfully designed to be user-friendly for all. Braille markings and tactile warning strips are provided where necessary to guide the visually-impaired. In addition, a ramp is provided for wheelchair users to gain access to the pools while slip-resistant tiles are used at the pool decks and for all wet areas.

8. In addition, Pasir Ris SRC is the first of its kind as an 'eco-friendly' sports complex, adding on to Singapore's recently earned accolade as Asia's greenest metropolis based on the Asian Green City index. Surrounded by nature, Pasir Ris SRC adopts a 'sports in a park' concept and blends seamlessly with the neighbouring town park without dividing fences.

9. The SRC is designed with environmentally friendly and energy-saving features such as a rainwater-harvesting system to irrigate surrounding plants, vertical 'green' walls and landscaping to reduce ambient heat gained, and photo-voltaic cells for energy generation.

10. "Pasir Ris SRC will be the first SRC in Singapore specially designed to give guests the feeling of being in a 'green' sporting sanctuary right in the middle of the town centre. Not only does the new SRC make for an enjoyable environment for residents, the design helps limit our carbon footprint," said Mr Seow.

11. Adding to the 'green' mood at the Pasir Ris SRC official opening, nine trees were planted at the side entrance of the SRC by DPM Teo, Acting Minister Chan, MPs for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC and Punggol East SMC, as well as Mr Nair.

12.  SSC is also aiming for Pasir Ris SRC to attain the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark platinum award, the highest accolade given to environmentally friendly buildings in Singapore.
