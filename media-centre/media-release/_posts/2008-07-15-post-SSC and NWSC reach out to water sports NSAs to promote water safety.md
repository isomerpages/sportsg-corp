### **SSC and NWSC reach out to water sports NSAs to promote water safety**

Singapore, 15 July 2008 - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and the National Water Safety Council (NWSC) today engaged all National Sports Associations (NSA) involved in water sports in a dialogue session to see how the different parties can come together and raise the overall water safety standards and awareness in Singapore.

2. Chaired by Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports Senior Parliamentary Secretary Teo Ser Luck, the panel of the Water Sports Safety Presentation cum dialogue session also included Northwest CDC Mayor Dr Teo Ho Pin, who is also Chairman of NWSC and Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO of SSC.

3. Said Mr Teo, "This open dialogue session is to gather feedback from the water National Sports Associations on safety implementation measures to find workable solutions that will make water sports safer. This is not a top-down process and it is good for the National Water Safety Council, Singapore Sports Council to work with the NSAs and the people to raise the overall water safety awareness in Singapore."

4. "It is important for the issue of water safety be co-ordinated from the grassroots level. Having this session with the water sports NSAs will help to bridge any gap in their standard operating procedures and existing safety framework," said Dr Teo Ho Pin, Chairman of the Water Safety Council.

5. "However, we must stress that safety is everyone's responsibility. This includes, sports associations, event organizers and participants. If everyone plays their part in observing simple safe practices, sports will be fun and enjoyable. I urge all sports-related organizations to commit themselves in raising their respective safety standards and promote safety together with their sports," added Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO, SSC.

6. The NWSC will collaborate with the NSAs and SSC to review water safety procedures and guidelines to minimize the possibilities of tragedies from occurring. In particular, the NWSC will work closely with the NSAs to promote swimming and water survival skills to safeguard against drowning.

7. "The NWSC's findings is that Singaporeans' knowledge of water safety is relatively low," added Dr Teo. "This is something that needs to be seriously looked into as it is less than desirable for a non swimmer to be taking part in water sports."

8. "But this is a ground-up initiative and therefore it is important for the NWSC and the SSC to work with inputs from the water sports NSAs to ensure that there is proper teachings and systems in place as this is a partnership and joint effort with all the stakeholders."

9. In attendance at this Water Sports Safety Presentation cum Dialogue Session were representatives from the following NSAs:
