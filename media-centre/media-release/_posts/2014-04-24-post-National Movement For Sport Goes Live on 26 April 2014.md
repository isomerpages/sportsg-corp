### **National Movement For Sport Goes Live on 26 April 2014**

Sport Singapore brings the latest in sports lifestyle to Singaporeans. Through ActiveSG, the local public sports facilities will be given a facelift, a creative tweak to sports participation and rejuvenation for studio programmes. This is on top of enhancing membership experiences to make sport a lifestyle choice. 

2\. Rebranded from ‘Super Sports Club’, ActiveSG was conceptualised under Vision 2030 to extend the reach of sports programming to all Singaporeans – regardless of age and abilities. This newly launched national movement for sport aims to create pathways for sports development to get all spheres of the community on board – from schools, organisations, corporates, right down to the individuals and families.

3\. ActiveSG’s three key thrusts to enable Singaporeans to Live Better Through Sport includes:

* Membership Experience
* Programme Design
* Facilities Makeover

**Membership Experience**

4\. Serving as a sporting social network for people, registered ActiveSG members will have benefits including exclusive invitations to members’ only events, priority booking of facilities, and complimentary trial classes. Booking of programmes and facilities will also be taking on a new sphere of social interaction through the new Membership Management System (MMS).

5\. Aiming to enhance social communities through sport, members can network by looking for sports buddies, form interest groups, and sign up for social events via the new MMS. In the next phase of ActiveSG, this portal will be a platform for forming sports leagues and zonal affiliation for members. Singaporeans and PRs can sign-up as an ActiveSG member via www.myactivesg.com from 25 April onwards.

**Programme Design**

6\. Recognising the popularity for studio fitness programmes, ActiveSG will also be sole provider of the new fitness programmes into Singapore such as Piloxing® and Masala Bhangra®.

7\. Variety in choice and continuously bringing in new interests will be a key mission in leading programme design for ActiveSG. Families will have the opportunity to learn, keep fit and appreciate the sport together. One such example is the collaboration with ActiveSG and Warriors FC’s Kids Warriors Programme. The parents would be involved in some of training sessions, and on other occasions, formed their own interest groups and played futsal while their children participated in the structured football training session.

**Facilities Makeover**

8\. Moving away from the conventional public swimming complexes, ActiveSG Sports Centres will soon include additional activities and props to make a trip to the swimming pool a fun-filled experience for all.

9\. Want to complete your swim with a land-based workout? Sports Centres such as Jurong West, Clementi and Ang Mo Kio (from May) will have a gym by the pool. New fixtures include Aqua Spinning for a cycling workout which uses water resistance, Flippa Ball – modified waterpolo for children, and an Aqua Rockwall for a splashing good time.

**Open House Details**

10\. Introducing the new offerings to the public ActiveSG will be holding several Open houses at the following Sports Centres from 9am to 6pm

* 26 April (Saturday): Jurong West Sports Centre
* 27 April (Sunday): Sengkang Sports Centre 
* 03 May (Saturday): Yio Chu Kang Sports Centre 
* 04 May (Sunday): Bishan Sports Centre
* 10 May (Saturday): Pasir Ris Sports Centre
