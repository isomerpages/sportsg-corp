<h3><strong>National Movement For Sport Goes Live on 26 April 2014</strong></h3>
<p>Sport Singapore brings the latest in sports lifestyle to Singaporeans.
Through ActiveSG, the local public sports facilities will be given a facelift,
a creative tweak to sports participation and rejuvenation for studio programmes.
This is on top of enhancing membership experiences to make sport a lifestyle
choice.</p>
<p>2. Rebranded from ‘Super Sports Club’, ActiveSG was conceptualised under
Vision 2030 to extend the reach of sports programming to all Singaporeans
– regardless of age and abilities. This newly launched national movement
for sport aims to create pathways for sports development to get all spheres
of the community on board – from schools, organisations, corporates, right
down to the individuals and families.</p>
<p>3. ActiveSG’s three key thrusts to enable Singaporeans to Live Better
Through Sport includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Membership Experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programme Design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilities Makeover</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Membership Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>4. Serving as a sporting social network for people, registered ActiveSG
members will have benefits including exclusive invitations to members’
only events, priority booking of facilities, and complimentary trial classes.
Booking of programmes and facilities will also be taking on a new sphere
of social interaction through the new Membership Management System (MMS).</p>
<p>5. Aiming to enhance social communities through sport, members can network
by looking for sports buddies, form interest groups, and sign up for social
events via the new MMS. In the next phase of ActiveSG, this portal will
be a platform for forming sports leagues and zonal affiliation for members.
Singaporeans and PRs can sign-up as an ActiveSG member via www.myactivesg.com
from 25 April onwards.</p>
<p><strong>Programme Design</strong>
</p>
<p>6. Recognising the popularity for studio fitness programmes, ActiveSG
will also be sole provider of the new fitness programmes into Singapore
such as Piloxing® and Masala Bhangra®.</p>
<p>7. Variety in choice and continuously bringing in new interests will be
a key mission in leading programme design for ActiveSG. Families will have
the opportunity to learn, keep fit and appreciate the sport together. One
such example is the collaboration with ActiveSG and Warriors FC’s Kids
Warriors Programme. The parents would be involved in some of training sessions,
and on other occasions, formed their own interest groups and played futsal
while their children participated in the structured football training session.</p>
<p><strong>Facilities Makeover</strong>
</p>
<p>8. Moving away from the conventional public swimming complexes, ActiveSG
Sports Centres will soon include additional activities and props to make
a trip to the swimming pool a fun-filled experience for all.</p>
<p>9. Want to complete your swim with a land-based workout? Sports Centres
such as Jurong West, Clementi and Ang Mo Kio (from May) will have a gym
by the pool. New fixtures include Aqua Spinning for a cycling workout which
uses water resistance, Flippa Ball – modified waterpolo for children, and
an Aqua Rockwall for a splashing good time.</p>
