### **SEA Games carnival opening promises a June holidays like never before**

With six days to go till the Opening Ceremony of the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, the Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) has unveiled another opportunity for the community to feel excited and be involved in the Games – the 28th SEA Games Carnival. Themed around the SEA Games mascot, Nila, the carnival promises a June Holidays like no other.  
  
Held at the Singapore Sports Hub, carnival-goers will get to pit their wits and skills in a variety of sports and games, but with an interesting twist, such as the 300-degree table tennis table, hockey-golf, pool-soccer, the gravity defying ‘Walk-On-Water” and the first ever laser-tag battles at the Sports Hub.  
  
Also, a fantastic occasion for families with young children, the carnival will feature a Junior Zone with colourful inflatables such as a 10-meter tall Giant Slide, an obstacle course bouncy castle and an inflatable rock climbing facility. For those who prefer a quieter bonding time, they can try their hands on Nila themed art & craft and bring home their very own Tote bags, Nila badges or even paint a torch. Other activities at the Junior Zone include face-painting, photo-booths, air-brush tattoo.  
  
Beyond the different activity stations, the carnival will also provide visitors with a chance to sit back and listen to local artistes that include Daphne Khoo, Tabitha Nauser, The Sam Willows, Tay Kewei and Charlie Lim. Performances by these artistes will be held every Saturdays and Sundays from 2 - 6pm during the duration of the carnival.  
  
The Carnival will also feature an especially choreographed lightshow every evening as well as a dance and percussion performance, “A Day At The Games” at 9pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, except for 5 and 16 June. The ambience will be further enhanced by roving acts such as stilt-walkers, jugglers, balloon sculptures, and unicyclists.Athletes meet and greet sessions will also be planned following medal wins, in which the schedule and details are to be confirmed.  
  
The carnival is part of several fringe activities that will be available for the public and is aimed to rally communities to get involved in the SEA Games experience, all of which will be free.

Ms Lee Huei Chern, Head, Community Engagement & Merchandising, SINGSOC says, “This is a special year for all Singaporeans. It is Singapore’s 50th Anniversary and our turn to host the SEA Games after 22 years. So, we wanted to have something for everyone at the Games, to bring communities together and invoke a sense of pride and ownership in Singaporeans."  

Adds Ms Lee, “Withthe Games happening during the June School Holidays, we wanted a make it a holiday like no other, one where not only will you have fun but also be inspired by the fighting spirits of the athletes. This carnival is a great opportunity for everyone to experience the SEA Games in a fun and memorable way, from taking part in a wide variety of leisure activities to cheering for our athletes at the sporting venues. There will never be a June like this again!”  

The 28th SEA Games Carnival is on from 31 May to 16 June 2015 and runs from 10am to 9pm daily, except on 5 June, when it closes at 5pm, 7 June when it opens at 9am and 16 June when it closes at 5pm.
