### **Taking The Search For POSB Everyday Champions For Sports To The Heartlands**

**Singapore, 28 February 2010** - The Sengkang Sports and Recreation Centre was the venue for the launch of the POSB Everyday Champions for Sports Award 2010 today.

2. The Award recognises individuals, coaches and organisations for contributing consistently and selflessly to the championing and promotion of sports. They energise the local sports scene and inspire others to embrace a sports culture in Singapore, in line with the Let's Play spirit.

3. The Guest-of-Honour for the launch was Mr Zainudin Nordin, Mayor for Central Singapore District. Hosting the launch was Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Sports Council (SSC). Also present to grace the launch was Mr Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head, Consumer Banking Group (Singapore) DBS Bank.

4. This year, the launch at Central Singapore signals a concerted effort to take the search for the POSB Everyday Champions for Sports to the heartlands, where many people, quietly but with unswerving dedication and passion, encourage others to play, watch and cheer sports but more importantly, grow through sports. Various roadshows to showcase the POSB Everyday Champions for Sports Award are lined up at locations throughout the island, such as Jurong Point, Hougang, Pasir Ris Park and United Square. This ensures that the search for the next POSB Everyday Champions for Sports goes deep into the community. A set of posters featuring some winners of the 2009 Awards will also be displayed at public venues such as community centres and Sports and Recreation Centres to urge members of the public to nominate their deserving POSB Everyday Champions for Sports.

5. In his speech, Mayor Zainudin said, "As sports are a great way of building strong bonds among people, these everyday champions not only touch the lives of people but also enrich our community by making it stronger and more resilient." He cited the example of Ms Joyce Leong, who hails from the Central Singapore District and is featured in one of the posters. Said Mayor Zainudin: "A cyclist who is passionate about her sport, Joyce has founded a cycling group that inculcates a sense of camaraderie. From coordinating daily rides to organising birthday celebrations and creating special awards that encourage her riders, there is nothing this enthusiastic cyclist has not done to encourage teamwork and bonding for her club and its members."

6. Agreeing with the Mayor, Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer of Singapore Sports Council, said, "The POSB Everyday Champions for Sports Award is all about recognising the contributions of Singaporeans and organisations that have gone beyond the call of duty to promote sports. It is a meaningful way to honour these sport advocates. We hope that telling their stories will encourage Singaporeans to be more active in sports and motivate others to aspire to be like them."

7. "We have more people enjoying and playing sports than ever before in our history. And this did not happen by chance. These Everyday Champions bring the true value of sports to others. They may not be on the podium winning medals, but they are one of the key reasons behind the success of Sporting Singapore. They serve as role models for the next generation -and this includes athletes of all levels, coaches, officials and, of course, fans and spectators," added Mr Oon.

8. Having served generations of Singaporeans, and known to be "neighbours first, bankers second", POSB is sponsoring the Award for the consecutive second year. Said Mr Jeremy Soo, Managing Director and Head, Consumer Banking Group (Singapore), DBS Bank, "POSB is the People's Bank and it is heartening to note that amongst our 4 million POSB customers are these everyday champions who are deserving of recognition and honour. The POSB Everyday Champions for Sports Award recognises these unsung heroes and POSB is excited to have this opportunity again to celebrate these everyday heroes."

9. All individuals, coaches and organisations will be assessed based on their contributions to sports from 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2009.

10. All nominations must be made on the prescribed nomination forms.
