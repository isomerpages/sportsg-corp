### **150 Marathon Slots On Auction To Raise Funds For SCMS's Official Charity**

_Only Slots For Kids Dash Remain As Slots For Main Categories Were Snapped Up Within Three Weeks_

**Singapore, 25 June 2010** - Running enthusiasts who wish to participate in the fully-subscribed Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) 2010, can still do so through the SCMS 2010 official charity, Club Rainbow (Singapore). Club Rainbow (Singapore) together with title sponsor, Standard Chartered Bank, have allocated 150 slots to runners via a silent auction. These slots will be up for grabs to runners via the silent auction on the SCMS website from 5 to 18 July 2010.

2. Interested parties can log on to www.marathonsingapore.com and bid for their slot (applicable across all marathon categories except the Ekiden relay) in the SCMS 2010 starting from 12.00 am on 5 July to 11.59 pm on 18 July. The starting bid for each slot is at S$300. The top 150 successful bidders will be informed via email between 19 and 20 July.

3. Successful bidders will not only have an opportunity to be part of Asia's premier running event, but will also be able to do their part for charity as all funds collected will go towards the Club Rainbow (Singapore).

4. The move by the organisers to release the 150 corporate slots to the public comes after requests have been pouring in for more places to be made available for enthusiasts who were unable to sign up for the event before registrations for the main categories were filled up. To date, more than 58,000 running slots have been snapped up by the public and this represents an average of about 115 runners signing up for the race every hour or about two every minute, since registrations started on 20 May.

5. The registration for the Ekiden Relay (100 teams) was the first to be filled up on 24 May while registration for the Full Marathon (19,200 slots) and Half Marathon (15,000 slots) closed on 4 June and 7 June respectively. At present, there are only about 1,300 slots available for the public in the Kids Dash category.

6. Chairman of the SCMS 2010 Organising Committee and Singapore Sports Council's (SSC) Senior Director in the Sports Marketing Group, David Voth, said, "The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore has definitely captured the imagination of the public and it is obvious that runners are obviously keen to set history with us. We know many runners are disappointed in not being able to get their place in the race but we also hope that running enthusiasts understand that safety and race experience are of utmost importance to us. Opening up the additional slots will give 150 runners an opportunity to take part and also do their part to raise money for the Club Rainbow (Singapore)."

7. Lee Boon Huat, Regional Chief Operating Officer, Singapore and Southeast Asia, Standard Chartered Bank added, "We are delighted with the overwhelming response from the runners and we aim to build on this enthusiasm to make it the top marathon event in Asia. Together with SSC, Standard Chartered is committed to making the SCMS a race like no other for the participants, spectators and the community in Singapore. This is an event for the community and we hope that people will come out on 5 December to enjoy the spirit of the race."
