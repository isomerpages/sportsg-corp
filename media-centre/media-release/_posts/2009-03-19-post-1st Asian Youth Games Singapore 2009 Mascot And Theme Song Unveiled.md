Members of the public are invited to participate in the 'Name the AYG Mascot' Contest which begins today. The deadline for the submission of names is 27 March 2009 and the official name of the mascot will be announced on 15 April 2009.

Your involvement can be as simple as being a spectator during the Games, cheering on our local heroes. Or you may wish to volunteer your skills then, to get even closer to the exciting happenings."

**About the 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009**<br>
The Asian Youth Games (AYG) is an international multi-sports event held every four years to complement the existing Asian Games. The idea was first mooted as part of Singapore's Youth Olympic Games bid in 2007. On 3 April 2008, the Olympic Council of Asia's (OCA) Executive Board unanimously agreed to award the hosting of the first AYG to Singapore. This decision was backed by all 45 members of the OCA on 6 April 2008.

The inaugural AYG, which will be co-organised by the Singapore Sports Council and the Ministry of Education aims to gather the youth from around Asia in a celebration of youth, sports and learning where they will engage in friendly competition and imbibe the Olympic sporting values of excellence, friendship and respect. AYG Singapore 2009 will see athletes aged between 14 and 17 from 45 OCA member nations competing in 90 events across nine sports from 29 June to 7 July 2009.
