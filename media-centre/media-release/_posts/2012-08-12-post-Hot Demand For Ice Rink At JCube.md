**Singapore, 12 August 2012** - The Rink, Singapore Sports Council's (SSC's) first ice rink for the community, has grown to be a popular sports destination for everyone from residents in the heartlands to corporates within the business community. Managed by CapitaMalls Asia, the rink has attracted over 80,000 members of the community since its soft opening on 2 April this year.

2\. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, together with Members of Parliament for Jurong GRC and Yuhua SMC, as well as Government Parliamentary Committee members for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Alex Yam, took part in an exciting ice hockey shootout this morning as part of the rink's official opening. They were joined by grassroots leaders and fellow residents as they celebrated the launch of their new sports facility.

3\. "Ice skating is turning out to be popular amongst both young and old, and a great family activity. Another reason why Jurong has become a place for fun and relaxation!," said DPM Tharman, who is also the Minister for Finance and Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC.

4\. A national Learn-to-Skate programme has been rolled out at The Rink since May 2012 to equip participants, from young children to seniors, with foundational skills in ice skating through a progressive five-week course. The programme, which is developed by the Singapore Ice Skating Association (SISA), in collaboration with the Singapore Ice Hockey Association (SIHA), is also offered through schools under the Sports Education Programme.

5\. Registration for the Learn-to-Skate programme has been overwhelming with close to 500 sign-ups and existing classes fully booked, while new sessions have been added to meet future demand. In addition, more than 250 participants are taking part in the first ice hockey league held at the facility. The Rink also provides an added dimension of fun and entertainment to guests in the form of disco-themed ice skating sessions on the first and third Fridays of every month.

6\. "Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned skater, the rink encompasses many opportunities for everyone to have a unique sporting experience. Regular programmes such as Learn-to-Skate, ice hockey activities and the fortnightly disco-themed sessions make for a fun and exciting time on ice during which the whole family can enjoy themselves," said Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, SSC.

7\. Located at the heart of JCube on Level 3, the ice rink measures 30 metres by 60 metres and is designed to host recreational skating, figure skating, speed skating and ice hockey. With its 460-seat gallery, mall-goers can get close to the action on the rink. They will also be able to enjoy the only rink-side dining experience in Singapore.

8\. "In our new Sport Facilities Master Plan under Vision 2030, we are looking at increasing the variety and accessibility of our sports facilities island-wide. The rink's close proximity to a public transport hub and strategic location within a shopping mall makes it a convenient place for everyone to engage in a sporting activity as part of their daily life," added Mr Seow.

9\. The Rink is the first sports facility developed under the Community/Sports Facilities Scheme (CSFS), which encourages the integration of community or sports facilities in private commercial developments for mutual benefit. As part of the scheme, The Rink best serves the interest of the general public based on its non-profit operating model, whereby all revenue generated will be re-invested into the operational and programming aspects of the facility.

10\. "This collaboration under the Community/Sports Facilities Scheme has enabled Singapore's only Olympic-size ice rink to be located in the heart of a shopping mall. The rink is a popular place for young people and their families to bond while exercising and getting fit on the ice. It also offers a unique experience for all, regardless of whether they are skaters. Members of the public can enjoy watching the action on the rink as they shop or dine, while retailers at the mall also benefit from the traffic to the ice rink," said Mr Lim Beng Chee, Chief Executive Officer, CapitaMalls Asia.

11\. To make ice sports accessible to all, members of the public can enjoy skating at The Rink at an affordable price of $21.50, which includes two hours of skating time, skate rental and the provision of gloves and socks. People who have their own skates pay only $14 for two hours of time on the ice.

12\. The Rink is open to the public from 10.30am to 9.30pm from Mondays to Thursdays, and from 10.30am to 11.45pm from Fridays to Sundays and on public holidays.

Under this scheme, the proposed uses must be compatible with commercial development and intended for public and community usage and not profit driven. The scheme was subsequently revised on 2005 and 2008 to include selected public sports uses ("Community/Sports Facilities Scheme").*
