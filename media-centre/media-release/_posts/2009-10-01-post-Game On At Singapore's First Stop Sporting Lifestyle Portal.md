### **Game On At Singapore's First Stop Sporting Lifestyle Portal**

Revamped SingaporeSports.sg portal with a hip new look, heightened interactivity to be launched

Singapore, 1 October 2009 - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) will be unveiling the revamped first-stop lifestyle portal for the local sports scene, SingaporeSports.sg to facilitate play amongst Singaporeans on 2 October 2009. The portal will offer a plethora of sports events and engagements for the everyday sporting individual and for those who simply wish to know more about the local sporting verve, as well as enables interactivity through user-content generation.

2. SingaporeSports.sg will be unveiled tomorrow at a launch event held at the Velocity Novena, which will run for three days from 2 October (5pm - 9pm) till 4 October 2009 (3 and 4 October, 11am - 9pm). The three-day launch event will see members of the public trying their hand at a variety of sports including floorball, table tennis, soccer and basketball at the Let's Play Sports Station, as well as Wii sports such as tennis and boxing.

3. The portal was set up in support of Let's Play, a nation-wide movement initiated by the SSC in May 2008 to promote a sporting culture, as well as a mindset change for everyone in Singapore to be involved in sports, in all ways, at all times. Since its inception, the website has received close to seven million hits. Commenting on the portal's face-lift, Rhonda Koh, SSC's Director for Marketing Communications said, "SingaporeSports.sg is the voice of Sporting Singapore and is a meeting place for groups and individuals who share the passion for sports and play. The revamped portal will be interactive, engaging and, more importantly, provides the community with 24-7 accessibility to a sporting lifestyle. By creating an all-encapsulating portal, the SSC looks to cultivate an enthusiastic sporting culture amongst Singaporeans and create an online community that is passionate about sports, intuitively weaving play into their lives."
