### **Unprecedented Transport And Baggage Services For Runners In Singapore's Pinnacle Race**

_Comprehensive Pre-Race And Post-Race Transportation Options And Different Baggage Facilities Catered For All Three Routes_

**Singapore, 11 November 2010** - With three different routes and a record number of 60,000 participants in the inaugural Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) 2010, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), the organiser of the Marathon, has prepared extensive transportation services and a comprehensive baggage handling system to ensure a smooth and enjoyable race experience for all runners on 5 December 2010.

2. Commenting on this year's transportation and baggage handling services, David Voth, Chairman, SCMS 2010 Organising Committee, and Senior Director, Sports Marketing Group, SSC, said, "Providing convenience to the runners is key to delivering a memorable race experience. The organising committee has given much thought and conducted extensive research with regards to the transportation and baggage handling services. What we have in place is unprecedented and will ultimately contribute to the success of the event."

**Transportation Services**

3. A pre-race chartered bus service and a complimentary post-race shuttle bus service have been arranged for runners participating in this prestigious race. Taking into consideration the early start times for the various race categories as well as the three different routes this year, the transportation services serve to ensure that runners are able to reach their respective start points on time with minimal inconvenience.

4. The pre-race chartered bus service will ferry the participants from 17 SSC Sports and Recreation Centres (SRCs) to the three different start points on a pre-determined schedule starting from 3.00am to 7.00am. Some pick-up locations include Tampines Stadium, Hougang Stadium, Jurong West Sports Complex and Queenstown Stadium. The pick-up locations are chosen specifically for the easy access of runners coming from all parts of Singapore.

5. Tickets for the pre-race chartered bus service will be made available during the Race Entry Pack Collection (REPC) from 19 to 22 November 2010 at the Singapore Expo, Hall 5. Tickets are priced at S$7 (NETS FlashPay Card) and S$8 (Cash). Participants who will have representatives collecting their Race Entry Packs can get these representatives to purchase the tickets on their behalf. Supporters and members of the public who wish to catch the marathon action along the running route and cheer on their families and friends will also be able to purchase these tickets at the Singapore Expo, Hall 5 during the Public REPC from 20 to 22 November 2010.

6. In addition, for the convenience of runners, there will be a complimentary post-race shuttle bus service to ferry runners from City Hall back to the vicinities of the start points of the Full Marathon at Orchard Road and the Half Marathon at Telok Blangah Road. The post race shuttle bus service is only available to runners - they will need to present their race bibs upon request in order to board the bus.

7. Interested runners are advised to queue up for the service right after the race as seats will be available on a first-come-first-serve basis. The post-race shuttle bus service will operate from 10am to 2pm, and there will be an expected waiting time of up to one hour during peak hours.

**Baggage Handling Services**

8. Extra care has also been taken to arrange for a smooth baggage handling service due to the three different start points. There will be one baggage deposit facility for each route and two designated baggage collection facilities near the Padang.

9. Participants of the Full Marathon and the Ekiden Relay can deposit their bags at Angullia Carpark (behind Wheelock Place), which will be opened from 3.00am to 5.00am; while Half Marathon runners can deposit their belongings at Seah Im Carpark (next to Seah Im Food Centre), which will be opened from 4.30am to 6.30am. The baggage items of the runners from the three above-mentioned race categories will be transported to the F1 Pit Building for their collection from 8.30am to 2.00pm.

10. Runners participating in the 10 KM Run can deposit their bags at the War Memorial Park, where counters will open from 5.30am to 7.45am. Collection will be at the same location from 8.30am to 2.00pm.

11. While steps have been taken to ensure an efficient baggage collection process for all participants, runners are advised to expect an average waiting time of 45 minutes during the peak period of collection estimated to be between 8.30am and 10.30am.

12. Key announcements and details on road closures will also be announced subsequently in the lead up to race day on 5 December 2010.
