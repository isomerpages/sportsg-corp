### **Team NILA Ready for 8th ASEAN Para Games**

With 12 days to go to the 8th ASEAN Para Games, Team NILA is just final steps away from being ready for yet another extraordinary Games.

As of 1pm, approximately 1,500 volunteers have collected their uniform and accreditation passes at the Uniform Distribution & Accreditation Centre (UDAC) at Kallang Theatre since the exercise started on Friday, 20 November 2015. A total of 4,300 members of the public have signed up to join the ASEAN Para Games as Team NILA volunteers since the call for volunteers began in July this year.

Embodying Team NILA’s values of courage, passion and friendship, volunteers have dedicated hours of their time attending multiple training sessions organised to get them ready for the Games. This includes attending a Disability Awareness session which equipped them with the know-how to interact with Persons with Disabilities. Since October 2015, more than 70 training sessions have been organised across 21 areas of games operations.

Present at the volunteer uniform and accreditation collection session today was Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, who came down to meet the Team NILA volunteers. At the event, Minister Fu thanked the volunteers for supporting the ASEAN Para Games and also personally gave out uniforms to the volunteers.

Mrs Susan Heng, a Dignitary Liaison Officer, was one of the volunteers who collected her uniform and accreditation pass from Minister Fu. Mrs Heng said, “I will be volunteering with my family, my husband and three children, at the ASEAN Para Games. This is the first time Singapore is hosting the ASEAN Para Games and we feel it will be a meaningful event for the whole family to participate in together. We picked up valuable skills on how to interact with dignitaries and people with disabilities during the training sessions and look forward to put the theory into action once the Games begin.”

“We are heartened to see many more new volunteers signed up for the Games. This shows that the spirit of volunteerism through sport is alive and growing,’ said Mr Muhammad Rostam Umar, Chief, Client Services, SAPGOC. “Our current cohort of volunteers for the ASEAN Para Games has the passion, commitment and experience to handle the challenges required of them during the Games. During the training sessions, we saw many volunteers shared their SEA Games experiences with the new volunteers. I am confident that come December, Team NILA will be ready to welcome our friends from the region for yet another memorable Games.”

The UDAC is part of the volunteers’ final stages of preparation for the 8th ASEAN Para Games. Located at Level 1 of Kallang Theatre, volunteers can collect their uniforms till 8.00pm, Sunday, 22 November 2015.
