### **$58.8 Million To Be Channeled To National Sports Association Under Singapore Sports Council's Funding Scheme**

Singapore Sports Council to Assist National Sports Associations in Strengthening Their Capabilities

Singapore, 8 April 2009 - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today that it will be channelling $58.8 million to the National Sports Associations (NSAs) under its Annual NSA Grant Exercise for Financial Year (FY) 2009. The amount includes direct and indirect grants of $34.1 million and $24.7 million, respectively, to the NSAs. Funding to NSAs have gone up, but it has done so during the economic downturn, hence, the SSC needs to be more prudent and ensure that the NSA grant proposals are cost-effective.

2. The SSC also shared that its funding strategy for the NSAs for FY2009 is aimed at building their capabilities. SSC will enable NSAs to raise their organisational excellence in areas of governance, compliance, sports planning and strategic development. This is aligned with the national programmes that SSC unveiled on 6 April 2009, which are focused on building capabilities across the sports sector to develop the next generation of athletes, coaches, officials and sports journalists and photographers.

3. SSC's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Oon Jin Teik said: "With upcoming key international sports events in the short to medium term, such as the Asian Youth Games 2009, Men's Junior Hockey World Cup 2009, Youth Olympic Games 2010, World Netball Championships 2011, as well as other major sports projects in the medium to long term, such as the SEA Games in 2013 and the Sports Hub, the SSC will need to urgently build capabilities across the entire sports sector to ensure Singapore's sporting fraternity is ready to meet these challenges. The NSAs are our strategic channel partners in meeting these objectives. Our strategy has always focused on building the NSAs' capabilities so that they can perform at the optimum level to meet Singapore's sporting objectives and priorities. Almost a third of our funding this year is going into helping the NSAs build their capabilities."

4. For FY2009, the SSC will focus on four key areas to build the NSAs' capabilities: multi-year planning, shared services, strengthening the NSAs' manpower capabilities and matching grants. Funding prioritisation will also be given to good quality programmes that are youth-centric.

##### **Multi-Year Planning and Funding**

5. Multi-year planning has been identified as a key capability that the SSC will work closely and develop with the NSAs in the coming Fiscal Year. Said Mr Oon: "The SSC and NSAs recognise the importance of multi-year planning. It is not an option if we are to perform at a higher level and meet Singapore's sporting objectives. The disbursement of up-front lump sum, multi-year funds, should not be a pre-requisite to developing multi-year plans. The SSC will provide in-principle approval for multi-year funds to be made available
to NSAs that present credible multi-year plans, starting from the FY2010 planning cycle (for disbursement of funds starting 1 April 2010), albeit the funds will be disbursed on an annual basis."

6. NSAs will need to meet basic criteria such as corporate governance and pre-agreed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The SSC reserves the right to withdraw or withhold part or all of the funding if any of the criteria or set KPIs are not met. The SSC has drawn up a framework and timeline for the implementation of the multi-year planning and funding, and will begin briefing the NSAs on the process from May to September 2009. The SSC will assist the Associations with the development of their plans, which should be submitted by October 2009. These plans will evaluated by the SSC between October 2009 to March 2010, with disbursement of funds to the NSAs in April 2010.

##### **Shared Services to Increase NSAs' Operational Capabilities**

7. The SSC has put in place Audit Shared Service for all NSAs to assist them in carrying out their financial governance to comply with the Financial Regulation 2008 for NSAs. For NSAs using this Audit Shared Service, they will be able to enjoy a partial subsidy from the SSC.

8. NSAs can also benefit from a comprehensive suite of financial services when the Financial Shared Service (in conjunction with the Charity Council) is rolled out in the latter part of the year. In addition, the SSC will also be studying the possibility of implementing other shared services such as marketing and public relations for the NSAs, for FY2010.

9. Inadvertently, yet fortunately, traction in the Shared Services arena will also translate into more jobs being created.

##### **Reviewing of Secretariat Funding to Boost Manpower Capabilities**

10. The SSC will undertake a review of funding for NSAs' secretariats to assess headcount needs and salary benchmarking for NSAs during this fiscal year. This is to ensure that NSAs are able to attract good-quality leaders to take up key positions within the Associations, and further professionalise the entities. Findings from the Review will be studied and recommendations are expected to be implemented by FY2010.

##### **Matching Grant Scheme to Benefit More NSAs**

11. The Matching Grant scheme, an incentive-based strategy to encourage NSAs to tap on commercial revenue, raise their own funds and be self-sustaining, was introduced in FY2008. The Grant is applicable only to new commercial cash sponsorships that the NSA secures or an increased sponsorship quantum from an existing sponsor. Administered on a first-come-first-served basis, the matching grant will be subjected to a maximum cap of S$20,000 per NSA per annum. For FY2008, 14 NSAs benefitted from the Grant.

12. Hence, for the current fiscal year, the SSC will be doubling the amount to $400,000. More NSAs will also be able to qualify for the Matching Grant as those that receive an annual grant allocation of S$500,000 and below (compared to $300,000 and below for FY2008) will be able to apply. Based on the funding allocation in FY2009, 46 NSAs qualify for this Grant. This matching grant is over and above the FY2009 annual grant that the NSAs will receive.

13. Key outcomes expected from the NSAs for FY2009 include achieving continued success at major international games and competitions such as the Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009 and 2009 Laos SEA Games; improving the quality of high participation
programmes; continued emphasis on youth participation for the majority of NSAs' programmes and events; as well as a greater level of organisational excellence.
