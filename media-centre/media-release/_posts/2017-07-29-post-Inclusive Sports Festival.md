Minister for Culture, Community &amp; Youth, Ms Grace Fu said, “Sport has the ability to build up resilience and confidence in people. Communities are beginning to embrace sport, because the benefits go beyond physical wellness. Parents are also taking their children to try out sports because it enables them to be more sociable and emotionally strong. This is why I’m very happy that we have the inaugural Inclusive Sports Festival at Our Tampines Hub. Through this Festival, we see people of all ages and abilities playing inclusive sports; it’s also a way of bringing communities and families together.”

The Inclusive Sports Festival will take place at Our Tampines Hub on Saturday &amp; Sunday, 29 – 30 July at Our Tampines Hub from 10am to 7pm.

**Media Factsheet on the Sports Facilities at Our Tampines Hub (OTH)**<br>

1. To enhance sporting access, a network of community nodes and innovative sporting spaces are being developed under the Sports Facilities Master Plan (SFMP) to cater to sporting needs at national, regional, town and neighbourhood levels. The majority of Singaporeans will have access to sports and recreational facilities within a 10-minute walk from their homes.

2. The OTH is the first of our five Regional Sports Centres (RSC) to be ready under the SFMP. In general, RSCs are able to support a wider range of programmes and events, as well as provide a better spectator experience. This is because of RSCs tend to be bigger than existing Sports Centres, with higher quality facilities suitable for national and regional competitions.

3. Given their close proximity to town centres, public transportation nodes and residential communities, RSCs serve sporting needs at multiple levels: i) residents living in close proximity; ii) residents who live beyond the town; and iii) national and club athletes, as well as sports enthusiasts from across Singapore.

The public sports facilities housed at OTH are listed below:

* Swimming Complex (1 competition pool, 1 multi-purpose pool, 1 training pool, 1 interactive water play pool, 1 wading pool; 1 Jacuzzi)
* Town Square (Football Stadium with 5,078 seats)
* Community Auditorium (20 badminton courts with 1,500 seats)
* Team Sports Halls (multi-use courts e.g. volleyball with 1,800 seats)
* Gymnasium
* Elevated Jogging Track measuring 1.1km on Level 5<br>
The following facilities are scheduled to be ready in Q3 of 2017:
* Tennis Centre (4 courts)
* Futsal Courts (2 courts)
* Hockey Court (1 court)

**About the Inclusive Sports Festival**<br>
There will be over 10 sports try-outs to reach out to the community of persons with disabilities (PwDs) and members of the public, to educate them about para sports options available. These activities serve a targeted audience and do not expose participants to the full range of para sports that are available in Singapore.

Since the ASEAN Para Games (APG) 2015, there has yet to be a large scale para sports event in Singapore. The Festival will serve as a continuation of the APG 2015 legacy, as well as drum up support for the Team Singapore training squad for the 29th SEA Games and 9th ASEAN Para Games in Malaysia in 2017.

The Festival will be held on **_Saturday and Sunday, 29 to 30 July 2017_** at **_Our Tampines Hub_** from **_10.00am to 7.00pm daily_**. Unlike smaller scale para sport tryouts conducted through the year, the Festival will house tryout stations for a full suite of inclusive para sports in Singapore. Besides tryouts, the Festival will also include fringe activities and performances by the PwDs and able-bodied performers. The Festival will also feature an inclusive futsal friendly (exhibition match) to be played by invited teams.

**Highlights of the event:**

* Over 10 sports tryouts (Archery, Athletics, Badminton, Boccia, Bowling, Goalball, Soccer, Volleyball, Table Tennis, Tennis, Basketball)
