### **Singapore to showcase the pinnacle of virtual sports at the inaugural Esports Week**

Singapore is set to host the inaugural Olympic Esports Week (OEW), following the International Olympic Committee (IOC)’s announcement today. Local and international participants will experience and witness the best of virtual sports during the four-day festival from 22 to 25 June 2023.

The announcement underscores Singapore’s strategy to encourage the development of sports in both physical and virtual forms to broaden participation by showcasing ground-breaking innovations and introducing new avenues for Singaporeans to engage in sports.

**Showcasing the best of virtual sports**

The OEW will feature the best of virtual sports – both hybrid physical and sports simulations. Those attending can look forward to experiencing a variety of virtual sports, including exhibitions of the latest technologies, panel discussions, education sessions and show matches. A highlight of the OEW will be the first in-person live finals of the Olympic Esports Series (OES), a unique virtual and simulated sports competition which may include Taekwondo and Archery.

**Unlocking innovation and opportunities for virtual sports**

With the accelerated interest and growth of the esports community, hosting the inaugural OEW will further strengthen Singapore’s line-up of major sporting and virtual sports events. OEW provides a platform to foster innovation, collaborate with International Federations (IFs) and unlock opportunities for local and regional businesses to develop capabilities in the realm of virtual sports.

“We are honoured and delighted to host the inaugural Olympic Esports Week in 2023. The Olympic Esports Week will catalyse the development of sport technology and innovation in virtual sports and showcase new avenues for Singaporeans to lead an active lifestyle. It will also have a significant impact on our esports sector, and more importantly create new common ground by bringing together different communities, especially sport and esports enthusiasts and the youths. We look forward to welcoming delegates and participants to our shores in 2023, and delivering a memorable Olympic Esports Week,” said Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth & Second Minister for Law.

“Singapore has played host to Olympic events including the 117th IOC Session in 2005 and the first edition of the Youth Olympic Games in 2010. It is our privilege to have this opportunity to co-create the inaugural Olympic Esports Week with the IOC and be part of this exciting milestone of the Olympic Movement. We look forward to welcoming our Olympic family and friends to Singapore in June 2023,” said Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, President of the Singapore National Olympic Council.

“Hosting the inaugural Olympic Esports Week marks another milestone for sporting Singapore, and we are excited to work with the IOC to bring this dynamic vision for virtual sports to life. The festival will be a platform for the local sport industry to collaborate with international federations and tech companies, and this will no doubt give a boost for the development of the local and regional virtual sports scene,” said Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO, Sport Singapore.
