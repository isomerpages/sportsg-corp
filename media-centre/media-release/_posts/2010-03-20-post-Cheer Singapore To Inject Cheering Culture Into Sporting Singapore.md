### **Cheer Singapore To Inject Cheering Culture Into Sporting Singapore**

**Singapore, 20 March 2010** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is issuing a rallying call to all Singaporeans to get on their feet and cheer at sport events through its new campaign, Cheer Singapore. Part of the SSC's Let's Play movement, the campaign plans to use cheering as a way to get more Singaporeans to use their voices and back our athletes as they blaze the trail towards the first-ever Youth Olympic Games to be held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August.

2. It is hoped that over time, a vibrant cheering culture will be developed in Singapore, in which a nation will spontaneously rally together and show their support for local athletes by cheering at events across all sporting arenas. Cheer Singapore was launched by Guest-of-Honour, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports at the inaugural National Cheerleading Championships, held at the Singapore Expo today.

3. In the heart of the Cheer Singapore will be a series of three cheers - each with its own unique purpose. The SSC is aiming to have these cheers reverberate at all competition venues across Singapore, for the first time, during the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games in August. Singaporeans are also encouraged to use these cheers to root for Team Singapore as they compete at major games such as the upcoming Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games in October and the Guangzhou 2010 Asian Games in November.

4. Minister Vivian said, "The Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games is a once in a lifetime occasion for Singaporeans and our athletes. This is our athletes' chance to make their efforts on home ground count. I urge all Singaporeans to head down to the various YOG venues to support and cheer on our athletes to help them blaze a trail, and make these games truly a Team Singapore success."

5. The first cheer, specially developed and performed by local singer JJ Lin, will be used by spectators during sports events to rally supporters together to get them to cheer during sports events and make their presence felt at the venues. The next two cheers will serve as victory and encouragement cheers - Singaporeans can use these cheers in celebration of Team Singapore's sporting achievements as well as to show the nation's continued support for the local athletes during competitions. Each of these catchy cheers will be accompanied by simple cheer movements.

6. "Sporting events, by their nature, provoke strong feelings in people," said Alex Chan, Chairman, Singapore Sports Council. "Sometimes they make us want to scream with joy. Sometimes they make us want to shout in frustration. Sporting Singapore wants to hear this kind of wonderful noise at our events. With Cheer Singapore, we hope to kick-start the culture with some organised cheering and cheer-leading. In time, this culture will become spontaneous, a natural evolution of who we are as sports fans."

7. The three cheers will be revealed in phases, with the full version of the first cheer slated to go live on Thursday, 22 April 2010. Participants of the 1st National Cheerleading Championships were treated to a sneak preview of one of the cheers after it was unveiled by Minister Vivian at the event. The remaining two cheers will hit the streets by end May 2010.

8. "The introduction of Cheer Singapore is the first step towards creating a cheering culture in Singapore," added Mr Chan. "We hope the three cheers will resonate with everyone in Singapore. We want people to cheer with one voice when we welcome athletes from across the world to Singapore."

9. Singaporeans can keep their eyes peeled for the cheer motivators who will be bringing the cheers to the ground through flash mobs that will be happening across Singapore over from 22 April 2010 onwards. Members of the public can also look forward to learning the cheers through series of roadshows that will take place from late April onwards. The cheers will be making its rounds to the various schools, including schools under the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games twinning programme.
