### **Singapore lifts 317,000kg in support of Team Singapore Powerlifters**

With less than six weeks to go till the 8th ASEAN Para Games (APG) 2015, 72 Singaporeans joined Team Singapore athletes, fitness groups, volunteer welfare organisations and local celebrities in a powerlifting competition to raise awareness for the sport. Present at the event, and participants at the upcoming APG for Powerlifting, were Team Singapore’s very own powerlifters Kalai Vanen, and Melvyn Yeo, who conducted powerlifting clinics for the public throughout the day. The event attracted a total of more than 20,000 people on its first day.

Held at Marina Square, the 8th ASEAN Para Games Unified Powerlifting Challenge saw teams of nine compete to lift as much weight as possible in 20 minutes, with the winning group taking home with them prizes.

The event was also graced by Mr Baey Yam Keng, Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth who was Guest of Honour for the event. In addition to participating in the Powerlifting challenge, Mr Baey also took part in the other activities available at the event including sewing a mini heart-shaped cushion for the Gift-a-Nila initiative and getting powerlifting tips from the Team Singapore powerlifters.

Powerlifter Melvyn Yeo said, “There were many members of public who came up to me to wish me luck for the ASEAN Para Games. It is very encouraging to see such a huge turnout for the challenge today and I hope Singaporeans will be just as excited to support us during competition as it is indeed a boost when I hear the crowd cheer my name.”

The Unified Powerlifting Challenge will be the final of three sport demonstrations organised to educate the public on the para sports that will be played at the Games, as well as to give them an opportunity to meet the participating athletes.

The public will be able to catch Kalai Vanen and Melvyn Yeo representing Singapore for Powerlifting for the 8th APG at the Marina Bay Sands Halls from 5 to 8 December.
