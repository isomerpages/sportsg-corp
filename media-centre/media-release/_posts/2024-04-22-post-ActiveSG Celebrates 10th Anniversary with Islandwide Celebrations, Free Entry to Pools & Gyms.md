<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 22 April 2024</strong> – ActiveSG, Sport Singapore’s
mass participation arm, was launched in 2014 as a national movement to
enable Singaporeans to live better through sport. Today, ActiveSG holds
a 2.5 million strong membership base, offering members access to a variety
of affordable, innovative, and inclusive sport and recreation opportunities
across its sport centres, as well as Dual-Use Scheme (DUS) facilities with
schools, island wide. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10<sup>TH</sup> ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION ACTIVITIES</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Sport Festivals on 27 April</u>
</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In celebration
of its ten-year milestone, members of the public can look forward to free-to-join
Sport Festivals at five locations on Saturday, 27 April. These include
ActiveSG’s newest facility, Bukit Canberra Sport Centre, and the recently
rejuvenated Delta Sport Centre. Each of the five locations will offer a
unique lineup of activities, from esports cycling to one of ActiveSG’s
largest aquatic fitness parties to date. There will also be free access
to gyms and pools at the five sport centres on that day.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “When ActiveSG
was launched ten years ago as a national movement, we set out to enable
people from all walks of life to live better through sport. Not only has
the number of our facilities grown, but the breadth of our offerings has
also expanded. Today, ActiveSG staff and Team Nila volunteers play an integral
role in encouraging lifelong enjoyment of sport and exercise – from creating
pathways for children and youths, to providing a variety of inclusive programmes
for seniors and persons with disabilities,” shared Tan Hock Leong, Chief
of ActiveSG.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We are truly
appreciative of the support that ActiveSG has received over the years and
invite everyone to celebrate with us from this April onwards. We have put
together a series of celebratory offers to commemorate this significant
10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary milestone that we have achieved together. Thank
you for being part of this journey. We are confident that your strong support
will inspire us to serve you better and hope that you will continue to
enjoy your active lifestyle with us.”</p>
<p><u>Record Breaking Dance Fitness Party</u>
</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSG will
attempt to enter the Singapore Book of Records for the longest Dance Fitness
Party duration, targeted to take place over ten hours across the five Sport
Festival sites. Over 2,000 participants are expected to participate in
this attempt. Members of the public can sign up to participate in this

<p><strong>ACTIVESG OVER THE YEARS</strong>
</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2014, all
Singaporeans and Permanent Residents who sign up for ActiveSG membership
are eligible to receive $100 ActiveSG Credits that can be used to offset
the cost of facility and programme bookings.</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of our
continuous efforts to promote active lifestyles and foster a vibrant sporting
culture across all ages, ActiveSG announced in 2020 that seniors 65 and
above will be able to visit its pools and gyms for free. Last year, ActiveSG
members between the ages of four and 12 years old received an additional
one-off $100 top up. ActiveSG’s competitions, programmes, and even sport
centre operations also provide ample opportunities for Team Nila, SportSG’s
volunteer arm, to be actively involved in our national effort to promote
sport participation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emerging from Covid-19, ActiveSG
expanded its offering of outside-school sporting opportunities for children
and youth beyond its Academies and Clubs programmes, piloting the ActiveSG
Cup in 2022 as a fun and friendly multi-sport competitive league for all
levels of play. That same year, the ActiveSG Para Sport Academy was also
launched as an extension of our Academies and Clubs to provide more opportunities
for para sport participation and development.</p>
<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tandem with the growth
of ActiveSG, the National Sports Participation Survey showed that regular
participation amongst Singaporeans has increased from 54% in 2015 to an
all-time high of 74% in 2022. Visitorship to ActiveSG reached almost 20.3
million in 2023, with over one million programme sign ups in the same year.</p>
<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More information about ActiveSG’s
milestones over the years can be found at<strong> </strong>Annex B.</p>
<p><strong>APPRECIATING TEAM NILA VOLUNTEERS AND ACTIVESG STAFF</strong>
</p>
<p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These milestones and achievements
would not have been possible without the strong partnership of Team Nila,
Sport Singapore’s volunteer force, who support ActiveSG’s competitions,
programmes, and sport centre operations on a daily basis. In appreciation
of their invaluable contributions, a Team Nila Sports Day on 20 April at
Heartbeat@Bedok kickd off the ActiveSG anniversary celebrations.</p>
<p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To end off the celebration
month, ActiveSG staff will gather for a dinner and dance event on 30 April
2024, where over 50 staff will receive Staff Talent Appreciation &amp;
Recognition (STAR) awards under a new ActiveSG recognition framework for
their commitment and achievements in service excellence, leadership, and
continuous learning and education.</p>
