**Singapore, 5 August 2023** – Team Singapore is set to send a total of 431 athletes across 32 sports to the upcoming Hangzhou 2022 Asian Games – its largest contingent ever for Singapore at the Asian Games. 

At the official Flag Presentation Ceremony held at OCBC Square this morning, Team Singapore fencer Miss Amita Marie Nicolette Berthier and wushu athlete Mr Jowen Lim were unveiled as the flag bearers for the Asian Games, with the former doubling up as the pledge taker. 

Guests-of-honour Mr Alvin Tan, Minister of State, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth & Ministry of Trade and Industry, and Mrs Jessie Phua, Acting President of Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) presented the Singapore flag to the Chef de Mission, Dr Koh Koon Teck, who then handed the flag over to the flag bearers. 

Dr Koh Koon Teck, Chef de Mission for Team Singapore, said, “We are sending our largest Team Singapore contingent to the Asian Games. The athletes have their targets set and will be working closely with their performance team to meet them. I am confident that if they continue to train well and keep their focus, they will be able to perform to the best of their ability in Hangzhou. 

“This year, we have also seen impressive performances from our athletes at the Cambodia 2023 SEA Games as well as at other competitions, and I hope Singaporeans can join us in encouraging them to continue to put their best form forward for Singapore.”

At the Flag Presentation Ceremony, Singtel announced the renewal of its partnership with the SNOC with the sponsorship of S$1.7 million in cash and kind support of Team Singapore athletes over the next five years. Singtel has been a stalwart partner of the SNOC and Team Singapore, supporting them in their major Games’ aspirations since 2012. Singtel’s commitment extends beyond cash sponsorship, as it has been providing complimentary mobile roaming services to enable Team Singapore to stay connected with their families and friends while at the Games and will continue to provide such support at the Hangzhou Asian Games, and other upcoming major sporting events.

More than 2,000 people came together to participate in the Olympic Day Walk together with the athletes and officials of the Hangzhou 2022 Asian Games. Participants joined MOS Alvin Tan in the 2.5km Olympic Day Walk around the Singapore Sports Hub, and continued to enjoy the activities organised by Sport Singapore as part of the Get Active! Singapore Celebrations.

The 19th Asian Games Hangzhou 2022 was originally scheduled to take place in 2022 but was postponed to 23 September to 8 October 2023 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There will be 483 events competed in 40 sports.
