_New appointments will beef up senior management team as SSC gears up for next wave of growth in sports sector_

Singapore, 19 March 2008 - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today the appointment of two members to its senior management team as the organisation gears up for the next wave of growth in the sports sector.

The two key appointments, effective 3 March 2008, are for Chief of Organisation Development helmed by Ms Lynette Lim and Chief of Knowledge Management &amp; Policy Planning headed by Mr Ho Mun Wai.

Lim will spearhead the SSC's drive to become a high performing outfit by maximising the full potential of its human capital while Ho will spearhead the functions of Corporate Policies, Corporate Relations, Research, Knowledge Management, and Inforcomm Technology.

Said Singapore Sports Council Chief Executive Officer, Oon Jin Teik, "The Singapore sports scene is going through a period of hyper growth, especially on the back of recent major developments such as the Youth Olympic Games, Sports Hub, Formula 1, Changi motor racetrack, and recommendations by the Sporting Culture Committee. SSC, as Singapore's lead agency for sports development, will now have to up its game to function at a higher level playing field in order to reap the full long term strategic benefits that these major developments will bring to Singapore sports."

"We have strengthened the senior management team as part of our regular operations review and continuous improvement process. Lynette and Mun Wai will bring in new dimensions of organisational capability development, which will play a vital supporting role to the work that SSC will undertake going forward," added Oon.

A leading Human Resource professional, Lim brings her wealth of HR knowledge and experience from a broad range of industries from the financial to the leisure industries ? having worked at Citibank N.A., Merrill Lynch (Singapore) Private Limited, UBS Walburg and the Sentosa Leisure Group. Lim is the recipient of the Leading HR Professional Award at the 2005 Singapore HR Awards given by the Singapore Human Resources Institute and holds a Master of Arts in Education (HR Development) from George Washington University.

Said Lim "Accelerated sector growth presents many opportunities and challenges for an organisation?s human capital. The key to developing a high performing outfit begins with aligning all staff by creating an effective line of sight ? bringing the big picture to the 'small screen' in the context of every employee's world. This must be under girded by a very strong values system, which drives all aspects of employee behaviour. We will also strengthen our internal staff capability development to ensure our staff have the right skill sets to tackle the challenges going forward."

New Knowledge Management &amp; Policy Planning Chief Ho Mun Wai was previously Director for Business Analysis and Relationship Management in SSC. He has been a key leader in transforming the holistic management of National Sports Associations, including the revamp of our relationship management framework. Ho holds a MBA from the Lancaster University, a M.Sc from the National University of Singapore, and is a Fellow of the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators. He has also attended the Stanford-NUS Executive Programme and the Harvard-NUS Executive Programme.

Ho, who has extensive experience in policy development from industry as well as academic research said, "The major developments we are seeing in the Singapore sports scene have altered the operating landscape and the way SSC will have to operate, engage its stakeholders, and project far beyond the horizon to chart the long range plans for sports development in Singapore. A key priority in the coming year will be to review SSC's role in supporting this new sports ecosystem and ensure we have the most efficient and capable organisation delivery system to meet changing needs."

The SSC also announced that Mr Eugene Chew, the former chief for Sports Management &amp; Development Group has left the organisation to join the academic sector for sports management. Separately, Dr Toh Kian Lam, Chief for Integrated Projects, will be leaving the organisation to pursue his personal interests. There are no changes to the remaining senior management team comprising the following:

* Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer
* Ms Goh Fang Min, Chief Financial Officer
* Mr Patrick Lee, Chief, Sports Facilities Group
* Mr Wayde Clews, Chief, High Performance Group
* Mr Kelven Tan, Chief, Sports Marketing Group

The SSC also announced other management appointments. Mr Poh Yu Khing, previously SSC's Deputy Director for Facilities Planning will take up his new role as Director for Sports Hub development. Poh played an important lead role in putting together the "sports &amp; venues" master plan for Singapore's Youth Olympics Games 2010 winning bid. In his new role, he will play a key role in representing SSC's interest in the development of the Sports Hub project going forward.

Mr Ng Eng Soon will take up the role of Director, NSA Management (Sports Management &amp; Development Group) under the direct supervision of SSC CEO Oon Jin Teik. Ng, previously SSC's Deputy Director for Sports Hub, was part of the project team that evaluated the programming component of the Sports Hub project. He will now be leading the relationship management of the NSAs.

In line with SSC's strong emphasis on sports safety, Ms Delphine Fong, SSC's Deputy Director for Sports Safety will now report directly to SSC CEO Oon Jin Teik. The Sports Safety division will play a dual role of sports safety strategy development and safety audit for the sports sector.
