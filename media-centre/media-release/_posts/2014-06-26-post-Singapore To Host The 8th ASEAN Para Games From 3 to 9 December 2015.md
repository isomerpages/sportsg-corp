### **Singapore To Host The 8th ASEAN Para Games From 3 to 9 December 2015**

The Singapore ASEAN Para Games Organising Committee (SAPGOC) announced today that the 8th ASEAN Para Games (APG) will be held from 3 to 9 December 2015. This will also be the first time that Singapore is hosting the Games.

2\. During the first Steering Committee meeting, it was also announced that Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth will spearhead the Games as committee Chairman, with Mr Sam Tan, Minister-of-State, Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth as Deputy Chairman. (Refer to Annex A for the full list of Steering Committee members).

3\. Mr Lawrence Wong envisions that the 8th APG will promote greater awareness of disability sport. “Through these Games, we hope to break down the barriers that often prevent people with disabilities from participating in sport. We want sport to be inclusive, with opportunities for all to participate. Through the ASEAN Para Games, we want to bring together more partners who share this vision of sport without boundaries, and take concrete steps towards building a more active and inclusive society in Singapore.”

4\. Inclusiveness and ownership of the Games will be key features of the 8th APG. SAPGOC will engage a wide range of stakeholders to incorporate different perspectives in organising the Games. SAPGOC also intends to partner sport associations, Volunteer Welfare Organisations, schools (including Special Education schools), social enterprises and corporations to play a part in the Games – from athletes, officials, volunteers, to performers, service providers, and committee members.The main areas of contribution considered in the composition of the Steering Committee members include: Community Engagement, Team Singapore and disability sport development, and Corporate Social Responsibility. Each steering committee member has the unique experience or expertise to provide the perspectives, ideas, and guidance needed for these important areas.

5\. “I feel privileged to be part of the ASEAN Para Games Steering Committee. As an athlete myself, I hope to bring the athlete’s perspective to the table and make a valuable contribution to the Games,” said Ms Yip Pin Xiu, Paralympic Gold Medallist. “The ASEAN Para Games is a significant event not just for the disabled community, but also for the community-at-large to appreciate and support disabled sport. I believe that our para-athletes who are competing on our home ground in December next year will inspire the community to live better through sport for generations to come.”

6\. The eighth biennial Games will wrap up SG50 celebrations and is expected to host over 2,000 athletes and officials during the December school holidays next year. This 7-day multi-sport event will have 12 to 15 sports with their competition venues mainly at the Singapore Sports Hub and Kallang areas.

7\. Starting from September this year, members of the public can look forward to pre-Games activities which include an ASEAN Invitational Games in the City, carnivals, an art exhibition at the Athletes Village as well as a Community Torch Relay.
