*Community Games 2012 Kicked Off With 197 Teams Comprising Over 1000 Residents Competing in Badminton, Basketball, Bowling and Football Across the Island*

Singapore, 15 April 2012 - After more than 4,000 votes cast online over three weeks, the inaugural Singapore National Games (SNG) now has a logo and mascot. Yong Wen Yeu and Beatrice Cho, winners of the logo and mascot designs respectively, were overjoyed as they witnessed the official unveiling of their creations at an event at the Senja-Cashew Community Club (CC) today. The event marks the start of the Community Games (CG) 2012, which serves as the qualifying round for SNG 2012.

2. Unveiling the winning designs and presenting the prizes to the winners, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Adviser for the SNG Steering Committee and Minister of State for the Ministry of Trade and Industry said, "In the spirit of the Singapore National Games and the Community Games, we wanted deep community involvement and ownership by the public. The contest delivered on both counts - young design students showcased their creative skills for an important national event and over 4000 people voted for their favourite designs. I hope, in the same spirit, more residents will continue engaging in sporting events such as these, to bond and live happier lives."

3. 20-year-old Wen Yeu from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts received close to 40% of the total votes (997 of 2624) for his colourful logo design. The logo is made up of the characters 'S, N, and G' represents the spirit of sports - the energy and passion that bonds people when they play sports together. In addition, the 'S' in the design represents a person running and the 'G' depicts a person swimming.

4. Singapore Polytechnic's first-year design student, Beatrice's mascot 'Nila' was a clear winner, garnering more than 70% of the votes received (1028 of 1417). The lion with a heart-shaped face represents how people interact with one another and come together as a community, while its fiery mane symbolises the burning passion of the athletes fighting to win.

5. For their winning designs, Wen Yeu and Beatrice each received $1,000 cash and an internship opportunity at Publicis Singapore, a leading advertising and communications company that has been working closely with the SNG Organising Committee to manage the SNG logo and mascot contest. An ecstatic Beatrice has this to say about her win, "I'm very delighted to win this contest and that Nila will be the mascot for the inaugural Singapore National Games! It has been a very good experience and is definitely a boost to my portfolio. I'm also really looking forward to the internship so that I can learn more from industry professionals."

6. The SNG logo and mascot designs contest held in February 2012 saw about 35 logo and 16 mascot entries submitted from various design schools and tertiary institutions. After the first round of judging held in early March, four designs each for the logo and mascot were shortlisted.

Annex A: Singapore National Games 2012 Fact Sheet

The Singapore National Games 2012 (SNG) is a new biennial sports festival that bridges community participation and sports excellence will offer residents from all ages, races and estates the opportunity to be part of Singapore?s exciting sporting landscape. From the Sunday sports enthusiast, the arm-chair commentator, to the serious athlete, all can now play, compete, support and volunteer.

The inaugural SNG will see community teams pitting against each other in ten sports. The SNG will be jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), People's Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations, the Community Sports Clubs, as well as the National Sports Associations (NSAs) of the ten sports in the inaugural SNG. It aims to be a meaningful and memorable sporting festival that ignites passion, builds character, and connects people and bonds Singaporeans.

The Community Games (CG), which is organised annually, will serve as the qualifying round for the SNG in the years when it is held. For 2012, CG will be held from April to July and the SNG will be held from 1 to 9 September.

The ten sports featured in 2012 are: Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Dragon Boat, Football, Netball, Sepak Takraw, Swimming and Table Tennis.

#### **Annex B: Winning Mascot & Logo Designs for Singapore National Games Fact Sheet**
![](/images/Media%20Centre/Media%20Release/2012/May/SinagporeNationalGames.gif)

**Designer**: Yong Wen Yeu
**School**: Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts
**Age**: 20

**Rationale**:
The logo is formed by the characters 'S, N, and G' which stands for Singapore National Games. The 'S' in the design represents a person running and the 'G' represents a person swimming. I have chosen vivid colours such as red and blue as they lend a rhythmic feel to the logo. They also represent the spirit of sports; the energy and passion that bonds people when they play sports together.

**Designer**: Beatrice Cho
**School**: Singapore Polytechnic
**Age**: 19

**Rationale**:
When we utter the word 'Lion' the first word that comes into our mind is strength. It also upholds many beliefs, such as courage, power, royalty and wisdom. Sang Nila Utama, founder of Singapore and the Merlion is the reason I decided to name my mascot 'Nila'. The SNG will create friendly rivalry and bring friendship to another level. These elements are infused and depicted in my mascot by the fiery mane and the heart shaped face. The fiery mane symbolises the burning passion of the athletes fighting to win. The heart-shaped face displays love which represents how people interact with one another and come together as a community.
