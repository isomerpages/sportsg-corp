_Community Games 2012 Kicked Off With 197 Teams Comprising Over 1000 Residents Competing in Badminton, Basketball, Bowling and Football Across the Island_

**Singapore, 15 April 2012** - After more than 4,000 votes cast online over three weeks, the inaugural Singapore National Games (SNG) now has a logo and mascot. Yong Wen Yeu and Beatrice Cho, winners of the logo and mascot designs respectively, were overjoyed as they witnessed the official unveiling of their creations at an event at the Senja-Cashew Community Club (CC) today. The event marks the start of the Community Games (CG) 2012, which serves as the qualifying round for SNG 2012.

2\. Unveiling the winning designs and presenting the prizes to the winners, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Adviser for the SNG Steering Committee and Minister of State for the Ministry of Trade and Industry said, "In the spirit of the Singapore National Games and the Community Games, we wanted deep community involvement and ownership by the public. The contest delivered on both counts - young design students showcased their creative skills for an important national event and over 4000 people voted for their favourite designs. I hope, in the same spirit, more residents will continue engaging in sporting events such as these, to bond and live happier lives."

3\. 20-year-old Wen Yeu from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts received close to 40% of the total votes (997 of 2624) for his colourful logo design. The logo is made up of the characters 'S, N, and G' represents the spirit of sports - the energy and passion that bonds people when they play sports together. In addition, the 'S' in the design represents a person running and the 'G' depicts a person swimming.

4\. Singapore Polytechnic's first-year design student, Beatrice's mascot 'Nila' was a clear winner, garnering more than 70% of the votes received (1028 of 1417). The lion with a heart-shaped face represents how people interact with one another and come together as a community, while its fiery mane symbolises the burning passion of the athletes fighting to win.

5\. For their winning designs, Wen Yeu and Beatrice each received $1,000 cash and an internship opportunity at Publicis Singapore, a leading advertising and communications company that has been working closely with the SNG Organising Committee to manage the SNG logo and mascot contest. An ecstatic Beatrice has this to say about her win, "I'm very delighted to win this contest and that Nila will be the mascot for the inaugural Singapore National Games! It has been a very good experience and is definitely a boost to my portfolio. I'm also really looking forward to the internship so that I can learn more from industry professionals."

6\. The SNG logo and mascot designs contest held in February 2012 saw about 35 logo and 16 mascot entries submitted from various design schools and tertiary institutions. After the first round of judging held in early March, four designs each for the logo and mascot were shortlisted. These designs were there put up for an online public voting at singaporenationalgames.sg.

**Community Games 2012 Kicked Off With Four Sports**

7\. The Community Games (CG) 2012, will kick off on Sunday, 15 April 2012 with 197 teams comprising over 1,000 residents of different ages, races and estates competing in Badminton, Basketball, Bowling and Football at the CCs, sports halls and sports facilities across the island. The remaining three sports namely netball, sepak takraw and table tennis will commence in May 2012.

8\. More than 1,000 teams are expected to play in ten sports at the inaugural SNG which will be held from 1 to 9 September 2012. The sports are Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Dragon Boat, Football, Netball, Sepak Takraw, Swimming and Table Tennis. Participating teams from 15 clusters comprise residents from public and private estates of various ages, races and backgrounds. This supports the SNG's vision of developing a strong and inclusive sporting culture with enhanced social cohesion and bonding where everyone can participate.

9\. Two winning teams in every sports category will emerge from each cluster to qualify for the SNG 2012. This could be a dream come true for many a sporting enthusiast to play at a national level supported and cheered on by their neighbours and friends living in the same cluster and the community.

**Inter-Cluster Mascot Customisation Contest**

10\. From 17 April to 15 May, the 15 clusters can inject their unique identity into the SNG mascot so as to make it their own, through an inter-cluster mascot customisation contest. Subsequently one customised mascot will be produced by the SNG organisers for each cluster.

11\. In addition, the 15 customised mascot designs will be put up on the SNG website from 18 to 31 May for public voting. The three clusters that receive the most votes for their customised designs will win attractive prizes.

12\. The SNG is a community-based multi-sports competition jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), People's Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations the Community Sports Clubs, as well as 10 National Sports Associations (NSAs). Held once every two years, the SNG will offer sports enthusiasts of all ages an opportunity to be part of Singapore's exciting sporting landscape.

**Annex A: Singapore National Games 2012 Fact Sheet**

The Singapore National Games 2012 (SNG) is a new biennial sports festival that bridges community participation and sports excellence will offer residents from all ages, races and estates the opportunity to be part of Singapore's exciting sporting landscape. From the Sunday sports enthusiast, the arm-chair commentator, to the serious athlete, all can now play, compete, support and volunteer.

The inaugural SNG will see community teams pitting against each other in ten sports. The SNG will be jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), People's Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations, the Community Sports Clubs, as well as the National Sports Associations (NSAs) of the ten sports in the inaugural SNG. It aims to be a meaningful and memorable sporting festival that ignites passion, builds character, and connects people and bonds Singaporeans.

The Community Games (CG), which is organised annually, will serve as the qualifying round for the SNG in the years when it is held. For 2012, CG will be held from April to July and the SNG will be held from 1 to 9 September.

The ten sports featured in 2012 are: Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Dragon Boat, Football, Netball, Sepak Takraw, Swimming and Table Tennis. To bring the competitions to the heart of the community, the 2012 Games will be held at various venues around Singapore, including 20 Community Clubs, schools, the Bedok Reservoir and the Singapore Sports School. Teams will be formed according to geographical clusters. Members of the winning teams will each be awarded a medal, with trophies being awarded to the winning teams.

Participation will be open to Singapore Citizens as well as non-Citizens, including Singapore Permanent Residents. National athletes are also eligible to compete. However in general, National athletes and non-citizens may only make up at most 20% of the team size, or one member of the team, whichever is higher. In order to encourage wide participation from all age groups and races, as well as residents living in both public and private estates, team composition for all sports have been formulated through discussion with the respective NSAs. With various team mix requirements, it is intended that more enthusiasts with different abilities will be able to be part of this nation-wide competition.

Registration for the seven sports for CG 2012 Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Football, Netball, Sepak Takraw and Table Tennis has closed. Interested residents can still register for the remaining three sports:
Athletics, Dragon Boat and Swimming
Registration opens on 18 April to 31 May 2012

<img src="/images/Media%20Centre/Media%20Release/2012/Apr/SinagporeNationalGames.gif" style="width:200px;">

Designer: Yong Wen Yeu<br>
School: Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts<br>
Age: 20<br>
Rationale:
The logo is formed by the characters 'S, N, and G' which stands for Singapore National Games. The 'S' in the design represents a person running and the 'G' represents a person swimming. I have chosen vivid colours such as red and blue as they lend a rhythmic feel to the logo. They also represent the spirit of sports; the energy and passion that bonds people when they play sports together.

<img src="/images/Media%20Centre/Media%20Release/2012/Apr/lion_logo.gif" style="width:200px;">

Designer: Beatrice Cho<br>
School: Singapore Polytechnic<br>
Age: 19<br>
Rationale:
When we utter the word 'Lion' the first word that comes into our mind is strength. It also upholds many beliefs, such as courage, power, royalty and wisdom. Sang Nila Utama, founder of Singapore and the Merlion is the reason I decided to name my mascot 'Nila'. The SNG will create friendly rivalry and bring friendship to another level. These elements are infused and depicted in my mascot by the fiery mane and the heart shaped face. The fiery mane symbolises the burning passion of the athletes fighting to win. The heart-shaped face displays love which represents how people interact with one another and come together as a community.
