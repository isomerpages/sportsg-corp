**Singapore, 21 June 2011** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today a brand new non-competitive race category, the 5km Fun Run, for the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) 2011, to further cater to runners of all ages and levels, enhancing the Marathon's reputation as an all-inclusive race.

2. Building upon the success of the SCMS last year which saw a record 60,000 runners along three different routes, the SCMS 2011 is aiming to attract 70,000 participants and the Organiser believes the introduction of the new 5km Fun Run will further engage runners from all walks of life, in addition to the already expansive range of race categories including the Full Marathon, Half Marathon, 10km, Kids Dash and the Ekiden.

3. "The SCMS has been a key highlight in not just the local, but the regional sporting calendar as well. Having 70,000 runners this year, together with the introduction of the 5km Fun Run, the SSC is confident that the SCMS 2011 will continue to grow as the People's Race, playing a vitally important role in helping to cultivate a vibrant sporting culture in Singapore," said Mr David Voth, Vice-Chairman, SCMS 2011 Organising Committee, and Senior Director, Sports Marketing Group, SSC.

4. The SSC, together with title sponsor Standard Chartered Bank, will be unveiling more new and exciting additions to the race at the official Event Launch of the SCMS 2011 on Thursday, 23 June 2011, at Raffles Place Park. Major-General (NS) Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, will be gracing the event as the Guest-of-Honour, and will be joined by Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, SSC, Mr Ray Ferguson, Regional Chief Executive Officer, Singapore and South East Asia, Standard Chartered Bank, and other esteemed guests.
