### **A look into the life of a 28th SEA Games Athlete**

Over 7,000 athletes and officials from 10 Southeast Asia countries will be arriving in Singapore, in preparation for the 28th SEA Games.

Aligned with the vision of a Games village in the city, all of the Games participants, including local athletes and officials, will be hosted at 20 hotels in Singapore.

Greeting some of the football teams who have already checked into their Games accommodation at Days Hotel Singapore at Zhongshan Park, SINGSOC’s Chief for Manpower and Games Engagement Rostam Umar said, “This 28th SEA Games, in line with the Games’ “Village in the City” concept, all athletes and officials will be housed in hotels located near the city centre and competition venues to reduce travel time and we hope they get to enjoy more of what Singapore has to offer. Housing the athletes by sport gives them the chance to build relationships and we hope they can remain friends even after the competitions.”

Besides lodge and board, athletes will also enjoy the hotel group’s facilities such as the swimming pool, gym and business center.
