### **Team Singapore's Outstanding Achievements Recognised at Beijing 2008 Olympic Games MAP Award**

Team Singapore came together this evening at the Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP) and Team Singapore (TS) Appreciation Dinner to celebrate its outstanding achievements at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. The event, held at the Singapore Flyer, was attended by athletes, coaches, officials, partners and sponsors to commemorate Singapore's historic win in clinching its second Olympic medal in history.

Ranked second in the world, paddlers Li Jia Wei, Wang Yuegu and Feng Tianwei charted a new sporting milestone for Singapore when they secured the silver medal in the Table Tennis Women's Team event. This evening, Guest-of-Honour, Mr Teo Chee Hean, Minister for Defence and President, Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) presented the Olympic team event medallists with a $750,000 cash award in recognition of their victorious feat at the Games.

Singapore sent its best-prepared contingent of 25 athletes to the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games to represent the nation in six sports - Athletics, Badminton, Sailing, Shooting, Swimming and Table Tennis. Team Singapore had its best showing at an Olympic Games in Beijing, coming away with six new national records, one new Asian record and a historic silver Olympic medal that brought Singapore's 48-years medal drought to an end.

The contingent's exceptional performance at this Olympic Games cap an unprecedented run of historical best performances and record medal haul by Team Singapore athletes at the five major games held in recent years - the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games in 2006, and the 2005 and 2007 SEA Games.

"We are all very proud of Team Singapore's excellent performance at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Every athlete gave their very best and for Team Singapore to return with a medal along with a host of personal bests and new records, is truly remarkable. The achievements of our athletes at this Olympic Games show that Singapore can achieve big things amongst the world's best if we dream big and believe that we can achieve excellence on the world sporting arena. This momentous win has provided an important psychological breakthrough for our athletes to dream even bigger. This is just the beginning to many more years of great sporting feats by Singapore athletes," said Mr Teo Chee Hean, Minister for Defence and President, Singapore National Olympic Council.

At the event, appreciation plaques were also presented to sponsors and supporters of Team Singapore to thank them for their unflagging support during the Beijing 2008 Olympic games. They included Tote Board, Singapore Pools Pte Ltd, CapitaLand Retail Limited and Singapore Airlines.
