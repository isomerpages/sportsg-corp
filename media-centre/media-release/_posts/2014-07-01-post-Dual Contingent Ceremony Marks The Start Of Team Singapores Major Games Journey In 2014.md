### **Dual-Contingent Ceremony Marks The Start Of Team Singapore’s Major Games Journey In 2014**
More than 80 Team Singapore athletes gathered at a flag presentation ceremony today to kick off their journey towards doing Team Singapore proud at the 20th Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the 2nd Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing taking place in July and August respectively. Amongst the contingent are also four athletes who will be taking part in both Games.

2\. Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, Minister for Manpower and President, Singapore National Olympic Council said, “I would like to congratulate all our athletes who have been selected to compete for our nation, and to fly our flag high overseas. Every major Games is special and each celebrates a common theme. Through sports, we are able to connect to different communities in our society and it is only through one’s endeavours that the nation comes together to stand together as one Team Singapore.”

3\. Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for Culture Community and Youth also joined Minister Tan to present the Singapore flags as a symbol of honour to the Chefs de Mission (CDMs) and the flag bearers for the respective Games.

**20th Commonwealth Games in Glasgow**

4\. Opening the Games season is 20th Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Singapore will be fielding a contingent of 70 athletes to compete in seven sports, led by CDM Low Teo Ping.

5\. Says Mr Low, “Over the last few years, our athletes have been giving us more and more reason to cheer; and even our young athletes are performing better and better on the international stage. Not all will end up winning medals but, they have always displayed true determination and grit; performing to the best of their abilities. These are values every athlete should display every time they don our Singapore colours. I am looking forward to working with the team to deliver an inspiring performance that will make Singapore proud.”

**2nd Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing**

6\. Next in the line-up is the 2nd Youth Olympic Games, held in Nanjing, 16 to 28 August. 17 athletes will be representing Singapore in seven sports at the Games, led by CDM Mark Chay.

7\. “The Youth Olympic Games is an invaluable platform for our Team Singapore youth athletes to develop their knowledge and skills on a global stage. The Youth Olympic Games is unique in that the Culture and Education programme is just as important as the competition itself. Our athletes have trained hard and I am sure we can expect them to give their all with performances which will inspire us. I hope that Singaporeans will get behind our young athletes and cheer them on,” said Mr Chay.

**Doing their best in Glasgow and Nanjing**

8\. Amongst the strong Team Singapore contingent are four athletes who are given the opportunity to fly the Singapore flag high in Glasgow and Nanjing. The four women are swimmers Nur Marina Chan and Samantha Yeo, shuttler Liang Xiaoyu and shooter Martina Veloso. 

9\. “It is an honour to be able to represent Singapore in not one, but two extremely prestigious competitions,” said Ms Samantha Yeo, a Team Singapore swimmer representing Singapore in both the Commonwealth and Youth Olympic Games. She adds, “This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime chance that not many people get to experience and for this, I am extremely grateful. Lots of work will have to be done in order to maintain and be in my best possible form for both events, but with the support of Singaporeans cheering me on, I am looking forward to enjoying my race, to hitting as many personal best times as much as possible and to doing Singapore proud.”
