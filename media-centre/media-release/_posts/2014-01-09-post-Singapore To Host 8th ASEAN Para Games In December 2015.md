**Singapore, 9 January 2014** - As a befitting finale of a major year for Singapore sports, 2015 will see Singapore hosting the 8th ASEAN Para Games – a first to be held here. The ASEAN Para Games will be held during the December school holidays.
 
2\. Working together with the Singapore National Paralympic Council (SNPC), the Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), the 8th ASEAN Para Games Organising Committee (APGOC) is in the midst of finalising the competition dates and number of sports. The proposal is to have 10-12 sports shortlisted from 24 sports on the ASEAN Paralympic Sport Federation (APSF) list. This sporting event is expected to involve some 1,300 athletes and over 500 team officials from across the region.

3\. Mr Lim Teck Yin, Executive Committee Chairman of the 8th APGOC said: “One of the key thrusts of Vision 2030 is to have sports without boundaries and disability sport plays an important role in creating an inclusive society. Hosting the ASEAN Para Games in Singapore sends a strong signal of our commitment to recognise and celebrate the achievements of these extraordinary athletes. They have overcome many personal challenges and will do their countries proud at the regional level during the Games.”

4\. The Games will also offer Singaporeans a unique opportunity to catch several of the Republic’s Paralympians in action. Said Mr Lim, “We have in our midst several athletes who did the country proud at the London Paralympics in 2012. They are our sporting heroes and heroines and I am sure they will be looking forward to performing on home soil in front of their supporters in 2015.”

5\. Come 20 January 2014, a group of performers will put on a four-and-a-half minute performance to the song “Treasure Every Moment”, performed by Kelvin Tan Wei Lian (aka Chen Wei Lian) in Naypyidaw, Myanmar at the closing ceremony of the 7th ASEAN Para Games, as part of the handover of the Games to Singapore. The song will be accompanied by a display of Samba dance, which includes wheelchair dancers and a sign language interpreter.
