### **Team Singapore Driver Set To Make History At The World Touring Car Championship**

_Driver Melvin Choo Becomes The First Singaporean To Participate in WTCC_

**Singapore (14 October 2008)** - Team Singapore driver, Melvin Choo is ready to battle it out with some of the best touring car drivers at the upcoming World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) this October. He is the first Southeast Asian driver to compete in the annual Championship, organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).

Choo, who will be competing in the Thunder Asia BMW 320si, has signed up for two rounds of the Championship - the 3.7km Okayama International Circuit in Honshu, Japan on 24-26 October and the 6.12km Guia International Circuit in Macau on 14-16 November 2008. He will be up against the biggest names in tin-top racing including three-time WTCC champion, Andy Priaulx, current WTCC Championship leader Yvan Muller and other big names in the series such as Gabriele Tarquini, Augusto Farfus Jr, Alessandro Zanardi and Alain Menu.

Being in the limelight as the first Singaporean and Southeast Asian in the WTCC and at the same time, competing alongside some of the best touring car drivers in the world, including some ex-F1 drivers, will be a major challenge for Choo. However, the 38-year-old driver is relishing the moment as he looks towards competing on the world stage for the first time.

"It has been an extremely busy and intense year for me. I have been working very hard to break into the world stage. Now, having the chance to take part in the WTCC and at the same time create history by being the first Singaporean to be in the event is indeed a privilege. I will put my foot to the pedal and aim to fly the Singapore flag high at the competition. I hope my participation at the WTCC will open up doors for other emerging racing talents from Singapore to become known in the world motorsport arena," said Choo.

Fan Chian Jen, Deputy Director, Motorsports Industry Development Department, Sports Marketing Group, Singapore Sports Council commented, "Choo's participation at the World Touring Car Championship is indeed a historic milestone for Singapore sports. He has pushed new boundaries for the local motorsport scene by being the first Singaporean to qualify for the prestigious WTCC. His participation at this Championship is just the first step in creating a name for Singapore in the world's motorsport arena. With Team Singapore motorsports drivers such as Melvin Choo reaching new heights in the motorsport racing world, they will be an inspiration to youths who are considering motorsports as their career in the future."

This year has proven to be Choo's busiest and most successful year yet, competing in three different race series, winning at least a race in each one and chalking up an astonishing 7 race win and 10 podium finish. To date, Choo has claimed second in Division 1 for the Asian Touring Car Series. He is also currently leading in class B in the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia and lying third in the Aston Martin Asia Cup for the 2008 season. Choo is also the leading Singaporean driver in all three racing series.

David Sonenscher, CEO of Motorsport Asia Ltd, the organizer of the Asian Festival Of Speed, the Asian Touring Car Series and Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, commented on Choo's participation in the WTCC, saying, "Having Melvin compete in the World Touring Car Championship is a great indication of his talent and the level of racing in the Asian Touring Car Series. His participation will open up doors for more Asians to try their level best and to rise from the Asian level competition to the World stage. We wish the best for Melvin and will be cheering him on".
