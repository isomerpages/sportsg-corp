### **Singaporeans Poised to Rise with Extreme and Adventure Sports Activities**

Singaporeans with a penchant for speed, height and adventure will get their fix and adrenaline rush with a series of exciting extreme and adventure sporting activities this year. The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) officially announced today, the return of Xtreme Singapore and Adventure Singapore, with many highlights at these two events this year.

Starting tomorrow, April 28, 2007 the Xtreme Singapore circuit will kick off in Jurong East Central. From a one-day event at Downtown East last year to five different island-wide circuits this year, Xtreme Singapore will give young Singaporeans the chance to participate in a series of park-based extreme sports competitions which include skateboarding, BMX biking and aggressive inline skating. Co-organised by NTUC Club, Xtreme Singapore will be making circuit stops in other areas such as Ngee Ann City, Somerset and Tampines before culminating in the grand finale at Downtown East in December 2007.

Another highlight of Xtreme Singapore 2007 is the music-inspired Skate Jam, happening at its second pit stop on 16 June. Held in conjunction with Adventure Singapore at Ngee Ann City, skateboarders will perform to the beat of the music coming from the deejay's turntable. Renowned local deejay, DJ Ko Flow will be entertaining the crowd with his latest mixers while skateboard enthusiasts will also be wowed by Canadian professional skateboarder, Chris Haslam. The acclaimed Haslam returns to Singapore to showcase his stunts and tricks, first perfected during his early years in Singapore.

**Adventure Singapore 2007**<br>
Adventure Singapore 2007 returns in a big way on 16 June with many firsts, in particular Asia's first Downtown Wakeboard Rail Jam where wakeboarding will be made possible in the heart of Orchard Road. The public will get to witness exhilarating stunts from some of the best wakeboard athletes from Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. The wakeboarders will compete to be Asia's first Downtown Wakeboard Rail Jam champion.

Sports enthusiasts looking to push themselves to the limit through adventure sports such as abseiling, biking, kayaking and rock climbing can look forward to the return of Adventure Singapore's adventure race. Teams of two will complete the adventure race of either the 50km route (Open Category) or the 30km route (Sprint Category). The route will take participants through some of Singapore's hidden trails and complete tasks at iconic locations such as kayaking through Kallang River and abseiling down National Stadium before crossing the finish line at the Adventure Singapore Carnival at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza.

An inaugural bike display in the heart of Orchard Road, will see FMX bikers performing stunts on their motocross bikes at the Civic Plaza of Ngee Ann City. To further excite thrill seekers and the public, avid sportsman and popular MediaCorp artiste, Ix Shen, Goodwill Ambassador for Adventure Singapore 2007, will keep everyone at the edge of their seats with his adventure sports spectacular right in the epicentre of Ngee Ann City.

**A vibrant sporting calendar**<br>
Dr. Bervyn Lee, Director, Youth Sport Development division, Singapore Sports Council says, "Xtreme Singapore and Adventure Singapore are two events which we know appeal to many Singaporeans, particularly our youths and young adults." He continues, "With the support we have received from all our partners and the government, we are confident that these annual events can only grow from strength to strength every year. We look forward to a great Xtreme Singapore and Adventure Singapore this year."

"Unlike Olympic sports, many adventure or extreme sports do not get a lot of recognition. These sports are just as demanding both physically and mentally. I feel that SSC has taken a very positive and important step to promote these sports to a greater level. We might not be potential Olympic champions but efforts and passion are no less. With more of the young taking up adventure/ extreme sports, who knows what type of champions we would be able to generate in the future," said Ix Shen, Goodwill Ambassador for Adventure Singapore 2007.

"I am delighted that the SSC has expanded the Xtreme Singapore series to various locations in Singapore to allow more people to understand the sports better and to experience the exhilarating fun and excitement of the sport," added Ng Chee Keong, 25 years old, who came in 27th out of the 45 competitors for the international BMX biking Metro Jam competition held in Singapore recently.
