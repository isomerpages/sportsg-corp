</p>
<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 12 APRIL 2024</strong> – The Kallang Alive Precinct
has crossed a significant milestone with the completion of two new facilities,
the Kallang Tennis Hub and the Kallang Football Hub. Kallang Tennis Hub
will progressively be opened to the public from 15 April 2024, while the
newly completed wings of the Kallang Football Hub have been home to youths
from the National Development Centre (NDC) under the Unleash the Roar!
national football project since March 2024. This marked a step forward
in Sport Singapore’s ongoing efforts to expand our network of play spaces
and facilities, under the Sport Facilities Master Plan.</p>
<p>The Kallang Tennis Hub, Singapore’s first international tournament-ready
indoor tennis facility, comprises seven indoor courts, 12 full sized outdoor
courts, and two junior sized outdoor courts. This new facility will enable
Singapore to host more international tennis tournaments, while also supporting
the training needs of both high performance and budding athletes under
the Singapore Tennis Association and ActiveSG Tennis Academy respectively.
The Kallang Tennis Hub will open in phases to the public from 15 April
2024, with courts already available for booking from 8 April 2024 via the
Singapore Sports Hub’s online booking system.</p>
<p>The Kallang Football Hub, which functions primarily as a National Training
Centre, comprises one full natural pitch, three artificial turf pitches
and three futsal courts. Of these, four are sheltered, allowing for all-weather
play and training. It also features a high performance indoor gym with
sports science capabilities and youth-specific equipment. The Hub’s newly
completed wings have been home to youths of the National Development Centre
(NDC) since March 2024, while the men’s, women’s and junior national teams
have been training at the adjacent wing since it was completed in early
2023.</p>
<p>“Our vision is to transform the entire Kallang Alive precinct into a single
integrated ecosystem that serves the needs and aspirations of our athletes
and the wider Singapore community, including businesses and international
organisations. The completion of the two new facilities will enable us
to better activate the precinct and unlock synergies between the assets
that we have here. For example, the new Kallang Tennis Hub can be activated
together with other facilities in the precinct to host marquee international
tennis events for all to enjoy.’’ said Daryl Yeo, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer (Development), Sport Singapore and Chief Operating Officer, Kallang
Alive Sport Management.</p>
<p>Lim Hong Khiang, Chief, Sport Infrastructure Group, Sport Singapore, added:
“As part of the Sport Facilities Master Plan, we will continue to develop
and rejuvenate quality infrastructure to meet the evolving sporting needs,
interests and aspirations of Singapore’s population. The Kallang Football
Hub and Kallang Tennis Hub join several other new and rejuvenated sporting
facilities that we welcomed recently, such as the ActiveSG Sport Village
@ Jurong Town and Delta Sport Centre. At the same time, we are also building
more facilities, refurbishing others, and working with our partners on
initiatives such as the Dual Use Scheme to ensure affordable access to
sport facilities in land-scarce Singapore.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Members of the sport fraternity also welcomed the completion of the facilities.
They include Jasmine Quek, President, Singapore Tennis Association (STA)
“The Kallang Tennis Hub, which offers bespoke top-grade facilities and
high-performance support, represents an excellent opportunity to enhance
the daily training and competitive environment for our athletes. The all-weather
facility will enable the Singapore TA to host more high-calibre tournaments
in Singapore, with the objective of attracting players from the region
and distinguishing KTH as a premier regional tennis hub. This will not
only elevate the level of competition but will also support our athletes
as they prepare for major games, including the 2029 SEA Games. We are delighted
with this significant milestone for Singapore tennis, and express our deepest
appreciation to MCCY and SportSG for their support and confidence in the
STA.”</p>
<p>Alan Goh, Deputy Chairman, UTR! Executive Committee and Chief Executive
Officer Sport Singapore, added: “The Kallang Football Hub will serve as
a key venue to help develop our next generation of football talent to represent
Singapore. Having our young talents train alongside our senior players
in a quality venue will not only inspire our rising stars, but also help
foster a culture of excellence and camaraderie among our TeamSG footballers.”</p>
