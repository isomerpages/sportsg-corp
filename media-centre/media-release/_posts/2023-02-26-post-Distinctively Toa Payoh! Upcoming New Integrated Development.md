26 February 2023 – The Toa Payoh Integrated Development will conduct a public exhibition on 25 and 26 February 2023. Envisioned to be an extension of Toa Payoh Town Centre to serve the residents in the central region, it will be a lifestyle destination with community facilities and space.  A Regional Sport Centre, a Polyclinic, a Public Library and a Regional Town Park are being planned on the 12-ha land parcel located between Lorong 6 Toa Payoh and PIE. 


“We will continue to rejuvenate our town, so that Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC and Marymount SMC will remain a good home for residents of all ages.  I thank our agencies and partners for working together on this project, which will allow our residents to benefit from the upgraded polyclinic, library, park and sporting facilities,” said Mr Chee Hong Tat, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Finance and Transport and Adviser for Bishan-Toa Payoh Grassroots Organisations. 

<b><u>Regional Sport Centre</u></b>

The proposed sporting facilities, such as swimming pools, indoor sports halls, sheltered tennis, futsal and netball courts, gymnasium and fitness studios, and a football stadium will create opportunities for the community to come together and bond through sporting activities. At the same time, these elements will also help people achieve their health and wellness goals. In addition, there are plans for the development to house the national training centres for aquatics, netball and table tennis.

“Many past and current residents of Toa Payoh and Team Singapore athletes would have fond memories of Toa Payoh Sport Centre’s rich sporting heritage. It has hosted major games such as the Southeast Asia Peninsular Games in 1973, the Southeast Asia Games in 1983, 1993 and 2015, and the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010. Singaporeans also caught the ITTF’s Women’s World Cup live at its indoor sports hall in 2011. Above all, many residents come to the sport centre for their weekly sporting activities and exercise. The new integrated development is part of our efforts to bring quality sporting infrastructure closer to the community. Once completed, it will build on its heritage and be a boon to sport fans and the active lifestyles of many Singaporeans. With the amenities and services provided by our co-location partners, Singaporeans can look forward to a more vibrant space to create new memories and experiences together,” said Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, Sport Singapore (SportSG) 

<b><u>Polyclinic</u></b>

The polyclinic within the new development is part of Ministry of Health’s (MOH)  plan to invest in primary care, and to enable Singaporeans to receive care closer to home. With an ageing population and the prevalence of chronic diseases, there will be a shift in focus towards preventive health and early intervention to encourage the public to take charge of their own health. 

“The National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP) offers a holistic healthcare approach that caters to both young families and the elderly in the multi-generational estate of Toa Payoh. The redeveloped Toa Payoh Polyclinic, co-located at its new site within the new Toa Payoh Integrated Development with community and sports facilities, is well placed to meet the needs of the residents, from providing regular assessment for healthy child development to senior services such as frailty screening and health promotion interventions to encourage healthy and active ageing. Representing NHGP’s commitment to advance family medicine and population health, the polyclinic will offer NHGP’s Team let Care Model which is anchored on a proactive relationship-based approach of care delivery where sustainable and continuous care is given by a dedicated healthcare team. This ensures a greater continuity of care and improved health outcomes for patients,” said Associate Professor Chong Phui-Nah, Chief Executive Officer, National Healthcare Group Polyclinics and Primary Care.

<b><u>Public Library</u></b>

The integrated development will be a community destination with a new library to replace the existing one, providing a space where patrons can read, learn and discover from the surrounding environment, and the facilities and programmes to be offered by the National Library Board (NLB). 

NLB’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ng Cher Pong, said: “We look forward to working with partners and the community to build a bigger library in Toa Payoh that complements the integrated hub. We will also find new ways to offer services that will enhance the experience of our patrons. This is in line with our LAB25 (Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025) goal to work with partners, to evolve and innovate libraries and archives in order to better serve our patrons.”

<b><u>Regional Town Park</u></b>

Toa Payoh Town Park will be rejuvenated as part of the overall Toa Payoh Integrated Development with enhanced greenery and new amenities, bringing visitors closer to flora and fauna. The development and landscaping of the new regional park are shaped around the existing terrain and will retain its heritage characteristics and lush vegetation. More native trees and shrubs will be planted throughout the entire hub and integrated with the various facilities to enhance the existing greenery and biodiversity. At the public consultation, residents can also share their feedback on the inclusion of other amenities such as a dog run, multi-purpose event lawn and spaces, therapeutic garden and allotment garden plots for those seeking respite amidst greenery, as well as a nature playgarden for the little ones to connect with nature through play in a natural habitat. 

Mr Tang Tuck Weng, Assistant Chief Executive Officer, Park Management &amp;
Lifestyle Cluster, National Parks Board (NParks), said, “Many Singaporeans have fond memories of Toa Payoh Town Park, which was the first town park in Singapore. As such, NParks will conserve iconic features such as the Lookout Tower while enhancing the facilities and greenery in the park.  At the same time, we want to inspire the community to be stewards of nature and reap the benefits of being in nature by sharing feedback on the activity spaces and types of features they would like to see in the park. Research has shown that being amidst nature contributes positively to mental resilience and improves well-being. As such, we hope everyone will join us to help transform Singapore into a City in Nature, a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.”

Toa Payoh residents will be able to view the design for the upcoming Toa Payoh Integrated Development at the public roadshow taking place on 25th and 26th (Saturday and Sunday) February 2023 at the HDB Hub Atrium at Toa Payoh. SportSG, the lead agency for the development, together with its co-located partners, NHGP, NLB and NParks, will be gathering residents’ feedback on the preliminary design and its facilities as part of the public consultation phase of the development
