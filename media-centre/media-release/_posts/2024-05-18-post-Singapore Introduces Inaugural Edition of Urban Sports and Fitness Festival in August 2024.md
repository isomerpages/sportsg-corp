<p></p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 18 May 2024</strong> - Sport Singapore (SportSG) announced
the launch of the first edition of Singapore Urban Sports &amp; Fitness
Festival (SGUSFF) with a showcase of four key partners’ activations at
Funan Mall. Guest-of-Honour, Mr Eric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary,
Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth &amp; Ministry of Social and Family
Development attended the launch event which provided a teaser of what the
public can expect at the inaugural SGUSFF that will take place from 23
August to 1 September 2024 across various locations islandwide. The event,
a first of its kind, is set to bring together more than 10 partners from
the urban sports and fitness sectors to present a vibrant mix of activities
including parkour, street dance, fitness racing, and obstacle laser run
to engage and excite participants and demonstrate the diversity of urban
sports and fitness.</p>
<p>2) The exciting lineup of activities aims to increase engagement and sports
participation across communities in Singapore by leveraging the rising
popularity of urban sports and fitness racing amongst teens and younger
adults – especially with the debut of Breaking at the upcoming Paris Olympic
Games 2024. The event will see some of Singapore’s local athletes congregating
to showcase their expertise and will serve as a platform to rally communities
to support the local urban sporting scene.</p>
<p>3) Key activations for the festival include <strong>DanceXhibit</strong>,
organised by <strong>Recognize! Studios</strong> as part of Lion City Dance
Convention under SportSG’s ActiveGroove. This dynamic event will host street
dance performances from various local and regional dance studios and dance
crews. Bada Lee, an internationally renowned dancer and choreographer from
South Korea, will also be auditioning and selecting 30 dancers to undergo
intensive training, leading up into a dramatic performance piece during
the festival. Dancers can anticipate an exciting series of captivating
dance performances and enriching master classes.</p>
<p>4) The public can also look forward to <strong>Skateboarding</strong>, <strong>BMX </strong>and <strong>Parkour </strong>events
at the festival, hosted in Jurong Lake Garden’s Lakeside Skatepark and
Singapore Expo. Organised by <strong>Millennial Events</strong>, the <strong>Parkour Competition</strong> will
be a stop on the Japanese series, One Flow Battle, a contest format of
1v1 parkour flow battles, as seen in breaking and MC head-to-head challenges.
The event will also provide opportunity for introductory sessions, and
demos and meet and greets with national and international professional
parkour stars and coaches.</p>
<p>5) SGUSFF will also feature Singapore’s first-ever <strong>obstacle laser run</strong>,
a new format under <strong>Modern Pentathlon</strong>. The obstacle laser
run will be packed with adrenaline-pumping activities that include laser
pistol shooting and navigation through high-speed obstacle courses. Participants
from different backgrounds and levels of experience will be able to put
their endurance and strength to the ultimate test.</p>
<p>6) For fitness enthusiasts, the renowned <strong>FWE (Fitness + Wellness Expo)</strong> organised
by Hybrid Group, will be featuring over 50 leading fitness and wellness
brands and expects to draw over 15,000 enthusiasts to experience FWE’s
signature programming, dynamic stage events and showcase of the latest
fitness and wellness innovations. Another notable event to keep a look
out for is HYROX Singapore that attracted over 3,000 participants in 2023.
This year, organisers will be showcasing their latest product for the first
time in Asia during the SGUSFF. HYROX Youngstars, first introduced in London,
is designed to provide children between 8 and 15 years old an opportunity
to try fitness racing. The event format ensures a focused and engaging
environment as participants move through each challenge to jointly overcome
a series of challenges.</p>
<p>7) The array of urban sports available will serve to excite the crowd
and entice the public to take part in the festival! SportSG’s collaboration
with industry giants <strong>Hybrid Group, Recognize! Studios, Singapore Modern Pentathlon Association, </strong>and <strong>Millennial Events</strong> enables
the festival to expand its outreach to different communities, encouraging
mass sports participation across various demographics and widening exposure
to urban sports and fitness.</p>
<p>8) “The Singapore Urban Sports &amp; Fitness Festival (SGUSFF) mirrors
Sport Singapore’s goal to increase the accessibility of sports to the masses
and encourage higher participation levels across different sports disciplines.
For the inaugural edition in August, we are excited to be partnering some
of the heavyweights in the urban sports and fitness sector to curate a
vibrant calendar of activities for participants from all walks of life.
The event will also mark the first time we gather more than 10 partners
to feature urban sports and fitness events under a single festival. Partners
who are keen to be a part of our trailblazing efforts to raise the profile
of urban sports and fitness are welcome to join us in this thrilling journey,”
said Roy Teo, Chief, Industry Development, Technology &amp; Innovation
Group, Sport Singapore.</p>
<p>9) <strong>Troy Tham</strong>, <strong>an avid Parkour athlete</strong>,
demonstrated a routine to the audience at the SGUSFF launch. He is looking
forward to the key event in August where there will be an opportunity to
compete in the One Flow Battle. He said: “Parkour community has been growing
and it is exciting to be part of it. The One Flow Battle is a fast-paced
format that focuses on key moves in a short time. I am looking forward
to meeting and competing with other local and international Parkour enthusiasts
at the Urban Sports and Fitness Festival in August.”</p>
<p>10) “At FWE, our mission has always been to deliver a holistic well-being
experience that empowers people and connects individuals across all stages
of their fitness and wellness journey. With the support of SportSG, FWE
Singapore is set to transform the landscape of sports and wellness expos
in Asia. We are excited to introduce over 50 leading brands and welcome
more than 15,000 visitors, offering a first-of-its-kind experience that
reflects the latest trends and innovations in the industry. The launch
of FWE in Singapore is not just a milestone for FWE but also a celebration
of our commitment to fostering fitness and wellness lifestyle in Asia,”
said Mr Charlz Ng, Founder of Hybrid Group.</p>
