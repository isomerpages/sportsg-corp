**Singapore, 29 July 2018** – The third edition of GetActive! Singapore started off with a bang as 12,388 people got active by taking part in various sporting activities offered at the Padang during Car-Free Sunday SG.

The day began with the official Team Singapore Flag Presentation for the upcoming Asian Games, Asian Para Games and Youth Olympic Games, where more than 300 Team Singapore athletes gathered with members of public to sing the national anthem and take the national pledge.

This was followed by a 5km Nila walk/run where Guest-of-Honour, Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, flagged off more than 5,000 Team Nila volunteers and members of public to officially launch this year’s GetActive! Singapore.

Ms Fu said, “Sport brings people together. I am happy to see so many people of all abilities joining in to stay active together! For this year’s GetActive! Singapore, Singaporeans can look forward to a bigger line-up of activities and competitions. Through the partnership with SG Cares, GetActive! Singapore will also offer more than 300 Active Enabler activities for Singaporeans to choose from. I encourage all of you to participate and help others, or volunteer for a cause. Together, we can strengthen the bonds in our community and live better through sport.”
