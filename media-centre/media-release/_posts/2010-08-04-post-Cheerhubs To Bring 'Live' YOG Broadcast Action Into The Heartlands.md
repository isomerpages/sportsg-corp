<h3><strong>"Cheerhubs" To Bring 'Live' YOG Broadcast Action Into The Heartlands</strong></h3>
<p><em>YOG Events To Be Broadcast At Five SSC Sports And Recreation Centres To Foster Greater Community Spirit Among Singaporeans</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 4 August 2010</strong> - Singaporeans and members of
the public will have a chance to rally behind and cheer on Team Singapore
athletes participating in the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games (YOG)
at "CheerHubs" which are being set up at five Sports and Recreation Centres
(SRCs) all over the island. The "CheerHubs", a partnership between the
Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and StarHub, aim to bring the YOG even deeper
into the heartlands from 14 to 26 August 2010, the duration of the inaugural
YOG.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The public will be able to catch the riveting sports action 'live' on
jumbo projector screens (7.5ft x 10ft) at each of the five "CheerHubs"
located at the following Sports and Recreation Centres (SRCs): Delta, Clementi,
Woodlands, Sengkang and Tampines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We want to make YOG action available to every Singaporean, and screening
the YOG at our SRCs will add to the festivities and atmosphere surrounding
it by getting people excited and ready to cheer as one nation," said Mr
Oon Jin Teik, CEO, SSC. "We hope to foster a sense of pride, unity and
community spirit among Singaporeans that will radiate throughout the heartlands
as we celebrate together this momentous occasion in Singapore's history.
This is part of our drive to nurture a national sporting culture," he added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting the SSC in this project is StarHub, which has three dedicated
channels (StarHub TV Channels 241- 243) to provide 'live' YOG event coverage,
and the Youth Olympic News Channel (StarHub TV Channel 244) for round-the-clock
news reports on the YOG. In partnership with StarHub, the SSC will broadcast
the YOG competition events 'live' daily at "CheerHubs" from 14 to 26 August,
6pm - 10pm on weekdays and from 10am - 10pm on weekends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"StarHub is proud to partner SSC to bring the inaugural Youth Olympic
Games to the local communities where more people will be able to watch
the Games 'live'. We hope that with these screenings, Singaporeans will
be able to come together as one and watch their fellow Singaporeans compete
in the Games and rally them on. We would like to wish our athletes the
very best in the upcoming Games and we are rooting for them to do our nation
proud," said Ms Iris Wee, StarHub's Vice President of Home Solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add to the atmosphere and replicate a 'live' sporting environment,
viewers can expect fun-filled fringe activities such as distribution of
free snacks and refreshments, and the appearance of the SSC-MILO National
Well-Wishing Campaign's "MILO Mobile" to garner viewers' well wishes for
our athletes competing for Singapore in major multi-sporting events this
year such as the YOG, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Asian Beach Games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "CheerHubs" are being set up as part of the Let's Play movement, an
initiative by the SSC to encourage all Singaporeans to embrace sports as
a lifestyle choice, be it through playing, watching, cheering or volunteering
for sports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screenings will be subject to the availability of each venue. For more
