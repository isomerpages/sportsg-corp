### **"Cheerhubs" To Bring 'Live' YOG Broadcast Action Into The Heartlands**

_YOG Events To Be Broadcast At Five SSC Sports And Recreation Centres To Foster Greater Community Spirit Among Singaporeans_

**Wednesday 4 August 2010** - Singaporeans and members of the public will have a chance to rally behind and cheer on Team Singapore athletes participating in the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games (YOG) at "CheerHubs" which are being set up at five Sports and Recreation Centres (SRCs) all over the island. The "CheerHubs", a partnership between the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and StarHub, aim to bring the YOG even deeper into the heartlands from 14 to 26 August 2010, the duration of the inaugural YOG.

2. The public will be able to catch the riveting sports action 'live' on jumbo projector screens (7.5ft x 10ft) at each of the five "CheerHubs" located at the following Sports and Recreation Centres (SRCs): Delta, Clementi, Woodlands, Sengkang and Tampines.

3. "We want to make YOG action available to every Singaporean, and screening the YOG at our SRCs will add to the festivities and atmosphere surrounding it by getting people excited and ready to cheer as one nation," said Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO, SSC. "We hope to foster a sense of pride, unity and community spirit among Singaporeans that will radiate throughout the heartlands as we celebrate together this momentous occasion in Singapore's history. This is part of our drive to nurture a national sporting culture," he added.

4. Supporting the SSC in this project is StarHub, which has three dedicated channels (StarHub TV Channels 241- 243) to provide 'live' YOG event coverage, and the Youth Olympic News Channel (StarHub TV Channel 244) for round-the-clock news reports on the YOG. In partnership with StarHub, the SSC will broadcast the YOG competition events 'live' daily at "CheerHubs" from 14 to 26 August, 6pm - 10pm on weekdays and from 10am - 10pm on weekends.

5. "StarHub is proud to partner SSC to bring the inaugural Youth Olympic Games to the local communities where more people will be able to watch the Games 'live'. We hope that with these screenings, Singaporeans will be able to come together as one and watch their fellow Singaporeans compete in the Games and rally them on. We would like to wish our athletes the very best in the upcoming Games and we are rooting for them to do our nation proud," said Ms Iris Wee, StarHub's Vice President of Home Solutions.

6. To add to the atmosphere and replicate a 'live' sporting environment, viewers can expect fun-filled fringe activities such as distribution of free snacks and refreshments, and the appearance of the SSC-MILO National Well-Wishing Campaign's "MILO Mobile" to garner viewers' well wishes for our athletes competing for Singapore in major multi-sporting events this year such as the YOG, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Asian Beach Games.

7. The "CheerHubs" are being set up as part of the Let's Play movement, an initiative by the SSC to encourage all Singaporeans to embrace sports as a lifestyle choice, be it through playing, watching, cheering or volunteering for sports.

8. Screenings will be subject to the availability of each venue. For more information on daily broadcast listings, please visit SingaporeSports.sg during the period of competition from 14 - 26 August.
