<p><strong>Singapore, 6 November 2024</strong> – The Singapore Sport &amp;
Performance (SSP) Conference returns for its second edition on a larger
scale this year as it joins forces with the SingHealth Duke-NUS Sport and
Exercise Medicine (SSEM) Conference. Happening from 6 to 8 November 2024
at the Singapore Sports Hub, this is the first time the SSP X SSEM Conference
is jointly held, bringing together coaches, sport scientists, sport doctors
and administrators, to create new synergies and contribute to more robust
outcomes in the sport science and sport medicine field.</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s conference is “Harnessing Potential and the
Pursuit of Excellence”, where it will explore the best practices from youth
to elite sports, and how the ‘team behind the team’ comes together to provide
holistic support for the athletes. The opening ceremony of the event was
graced by Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth &amp;
Second Minister for Law.</p>
<p>Organised by the Singapore Sport Institute (SSI), National Youth Sports
Institute (NYSI), and SingHealth Duke-NUS, the SSP X SSEM Conference features
reputable speakers from across the world including Singapore, who will
address topics such as managing injuries while delivering performance,
the role of people in creating high performance environments, and integrated
support systems to enhance performance and potential.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Su Chun Wei, Chief of SSI, Sport Singapore (SportSG), and Director of NYSI,</strong> said,
"It takes a village to raise an athlete. Sporting success is only possible
when we integrate components of the high performance sport system to deliver
targeted and coordinated support for the athlete effectively and efficiently.
Through this conference, I hope that participants can enhance their understanding
of this interconnected ecosystem and foster stronger cross-sector collaborations
to uplift our athletes.”</p>
<p><strong>Dr Benedict Tan, Head of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine Centre</strong>,
said, "Sport medicine and sport science are highly intertwined. Sport medicine
stands apart from other medical specialties largely due to application
of sport sciences in everyday clinical practice. For example, doctors can
accelerate return to sport if they incorporate principles in exercise physiology
in rehabilitation. Similarly, coaches will add much value to their athletes
if they incorporate injury prevention and management principles during
training. This is why it makes so much sense to integrate the SingHealth
Duke-NUS Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine Conference, and the Singapore Sport
&amp; Performance Conference into one holistic meeting, to reflect the
day-to-day work of sport doctors, sport scientists, and coaches more accurately."</p>
<p><strong><u>Enhancing athlete performance and resilience under challenging climate conditions</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Apart from the keynote presentations and panel discussions during the
three-day conference, the SportSG and the National University of Singapore
(NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Heat Resilience and Performance
Centre will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the second
day of the conference. This MOU signifies the commitment of all parties
in developing a common framework to collaborate in the area(s) of enhancing
athlete performance and resilience under challenging weather climate conditions,
such as joint research projects in areas of mutual interest, in particular
maximising human health and potential, and mitigating the impact of environmental
health or climate change on sport and human performance and safety. Other
focus areas include collaborative events and information exchange, development
of education and training programmes, and shared use of equipment and facilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Inaugural Best Student Investigator Award</u></strong>
</p>
<p>On the third day of the conference, we will celebrate young talent in
sport science and medicine through the crowning of the inaugural ‘Best
Student Investigator’. Organised by SSI for the first time, the Best Student
Investigator Award seeks to highlight promising young researchers and nurture
them, as well as encourage new ideas in sport science and sport medicine.
This inaugural award was open to students in sport science, sport coaching
and sport medicine at both local and overseas institutions. The students
are required to be currently enrolled or have completed their studies within
the past 18 months and have obtained ethics approval in their research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Out of 13 submissions, five finalists have been shortlisted by a panel
of industry experts based on the quality of their research and its potential
to advance Singapore sports. The winner will be determined following their
presentations at the conference, and will walk away with a cash prize of
S$1,000. The first runner-up will receive a cash prize of S$500 and third
to fifth placings will each receive S$200.</p>
