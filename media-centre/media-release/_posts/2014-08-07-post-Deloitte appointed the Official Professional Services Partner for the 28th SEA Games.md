### **Deloitte appointed the Official Professional Services Partner for the 28th SEA Games**

_The association will boost international recognition for Singapore's hosting of this major sporting event_

The Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) announced today at a ceremony that Deloitte has been appointed the Official Professional Services Partner for the 28th SEA Games.

With its wealth of expertise in supporting the pinnacle of sporting events such as the London Olympics, the Vancouver Winter Olympics and the inaugural Youth Olympic Games held in Singapore in 2010, Deloitte will help raise the bar and further boost international recognition for Singapore’s hosting of this event.

Pledging over SGD$5 million in cash and value-in-kind services such as Advisory, Assurance and Consulting services, Deloitte is now the third Tier One sponsor for the region’s most prestigious multi-sport Games. 

“We are honoured to be appointed the Official Professional Services Partner for the 28th SEA Games. Just as we have delivered exceptionally to the Olympic Movement, we hope to deliver innovative solutions to SINGSOC. We believe that we will have a strong and enduring partnership because of our common values, including our commitment to excellence in delivery, spirit of innovation and desire to contribute positively to our community.” said Mr Chaly Mah, Chairman of Deloitte Singapore and CEO of Deloitte Southeast Asia.

As the official partner of professional services, this appointment underscores Deloitte’s social responsibility and commitment towards bringing the SEA Games spirit to the community, in alignment with the upcoming Game’s theme – Celebrate the Extraordinary.

"Deloitte has been involved in sports locally and globally. They have very good knowledge of sport and have the passion for it. SINGSOC is pleased to partner them as they not only help us during pre-Games and Games time, but also to build a legacy where all of us – sporting fraternity and sponsors, can learn and up the benchmark in organising sporting events. With Deloitte onboard, we have officially surpassed our halfway mark of target sponsorship amount for these 28th SEA Games.” said Mr Richard Seow, Chairman of Sponsorship and Marketing Advisory Sub-Committee, SINGSOC.

Deloitte will provide SINGSOC with expert people through a secondee programme together with advisory support. In addition, Deloitte will offer a flexible range of skills across a number of different operational areas as well as contribution through volunteerism to help the SEA Games organising committee in their goal of building a truly memorable Games for Singaporeans and regional visitors, and a legacy long after the end of the Games.

“Deloitte has a long history of supporting sport in Singapore from the Singapore Youth Olympic Games in 2010, to the support for Team Singapore athletes in delivering their dreams and creating cherished memories. Our recent partnership with Sport Singapore for the Sports Excellence Career (spexCareer) Scheme, fulfills and extends Deloitte’s commitment to our shared values of integrity, excellence, and commitment to one another – qualities and values that are also present in sports.” Mr Philip Yuen, CEO Deloitte Singapore.

“In addition, I’m pleased to share that many of our Deloitte athletes are competing to be selected to represent their nations in the Games; we are very proud of their achievements and hopefully we will be cheering them on at the Games for their hard work and commitment. The atmosphere in the firm also gets a boost as well – the chance to work, and sometimes even train, alongside someone like Derek Wong, the current Singapore number 1 badminton player is a great experience for our people,” shared Mr Yuen.

Deloitte Singapore’s employees include Derek Wong, Singapore’s current top badminton player and Commonwealth Games silver and bronze medallist, and netballer Suhailah Binte Kariman as well as other current national team athletes in sports like fencing, basketball and floorball. Through their innovative ‘Deloitte Ignite’ program, Deloitte provides employment opportunities – both full-time and part-time – to national athletes to help them develop their future careers while they represent the country. It does not just benefit the athletes though – it also adds to Deloitte’s diversity, allowing employees who are athletes and non-athletes alike to interact and share with each other different unique skills, mindsets and experiences that are mutually enriching and build a great team spirit.
