### **SSC And The National Basketball Association Get Set To Slam-Dunk**

_Historic Partnership will bring Basketball without Borders to Singapore for the First Time_

**SINGAPORE and NEW YORK, 18 May 2010** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) today announced a partnership that will tap on the growing popularity of basketball in Singapore to promote a healthy and active lifestyle to youth throughout the country.

2. Through this partnership, the SSC and the NBA will develop multifaceted programmes, clinics, and competitions to further engage Singapore's youth in health and fitness. The nation's basketball landscape continues to grow with more than 1,000 free-to-play basketball courts. These programmes will bring top-level NBA talent to the country to teach basketball fundamentals, increase participation, and give back to the community through NBA Cares events.

3. "We are thrilled to partner with the NBA to bring one of the world's most recognised sports brands to Singapore's shores," said Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Sports Council . "Basketball's benefits are numerous. There will be training opportunities, workshops, and clinics conducted by NBA players as well as community outreach programmes. Not only will our budding players have opportunities to rub shoulders with world-famous athletes, they will also improve their game and be inspired to reach for their dreams. At the end of the day, we will see many more people playing far more basketball."

4. "We are excited about the opportunity to help the Singapore Sports Council inspire a more active and healthy community," said Scott Levy, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of NBA Asia. "Basketball and the NBA are already tremendously popular in Singapore, and this partnership will build on that interest to improve the level of play and the overall health of Singaporeans."

5. To tip off the partnership, Basketball without Borders (BWB) - the NBA and the International Basketball Federation's (FIBA) global basketball development programme that uses the sport to create positive social change in the areas of education, health, and wellness - will visit Singapore and Southeast Asia for the first time from 28 June to 1 July 2010.

6. Basketball without Borders will feature NBA players and personnel as coaches for the top 60 youth basketball players from across Asia as selected by the NBA, FIBA, and participating federations, including the Basketball Association of Singapore. The camp will also feature extensive community outreach through NBA Cares, the league's global social responsibility initiative. Efforts will focus on grassroots basketball development and health-related issues with a focus on youth fitness. The camp will also feature a product donation to local community-based organisations that will include school supplies, clothing, sports equipment, and other items.
