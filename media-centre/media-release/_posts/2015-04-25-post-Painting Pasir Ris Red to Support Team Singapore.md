### **Painting Pasir Ris Red to Support Team Singapore**
_Pasir Ris is first heartland estate to get dressed, as Singapore Gets Ready to welcome the 28th Southeast Asian Games_

**Singapore, 25 April 2015** – In support of Singapore athletes' quest for success at the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, our housing estates will be decked up in red – the traditional colour that befittingly expresses every Singaporean’s national pride.

2\. Entitled “Paint the Town Red”, this movement will see housing estates and nearby community spaces dressed in the red of Team Singapore – from the blocks of flats, to the lamp posts to even the public transport vehicles that traverse the area. It will also include banners and posters of athletes who are living in the respective neighbourhoods and well-wishing boards. The movement calls for every Singaporean to adopt the colour red as part of One Team Singapore.

3\. Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also Grassroots Adviser to Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, launched the “Paint the Town Red” movement at Pasir Ris with athletes, grassroots leaders, and residents this afternoon. More than 600 residents and volunteers were involved in making Pasir Ris the first constituency to be dressed up.

4\. “It’s only been four short years since Singapore was given the honour to host the 28th SEA Games. This will be a key event of our SG50 celebrations. Having some 30 of our athletes living right here in Pasir Ris-Punggol makes the Games more meaningful and exciting for our residents. I know our sprinter Calvin and his family; and the Sheik Alauddin family who are Silat exponents; and I’ve watched our hockey player Haseef Salim mature since the Youth Olympics. I hope more Singaporeans will support and cheer on our athletes. Let’s come together as Singaporeans to Celebrate the Extraordinary, and our national spirit,” said DPM Teo.

5\. Team Singapore athletes who are Pasir Ris-Punggol residents including national sprinter Calvin Kang, were also present to see their neighbourhood dressed up for the first time today.

6\. Calvin Kang said, “It is an amazing feeling to see the neighbourhood that I have grown up in decked out in support of Team Singapore athletes and the 28th SEA Games. The country is rallying together for the Games of a lifetime, and I’m thankful to be a part of it, both as an athlete and a fan.”

**City dress up from mid-May**

7\. Moving beyond the housing estates and into the city districts, members of the public will witness Singapore’s transformation as it brings to life the excitement and celebration of the 28th SEA Games with a dash of colour.

8\. The dressing, rolled out in phases, is designed to create a celebratory feel around Singapore with the installation of lamp post banners, flags and NILA cut-outs put up on public buildings, sport centres, community/public spaces; as well as key heritage and cultural sites.

9\. Mr Toh Boon Yi, Chief for Community and Corporate Outreach of the Singapore SEA Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC), added, “Beyond the neighbourhoods, we are also going to dress up other areas in Singapore in 28th SEA Games colours. Singapore will busk in the vibrant atmosphere and Singaporeans will feel the pulse of the Games. We also call for Singaporeans to wear red throughout the Games as an expression of support for our athletes.”

10\. Mr Toh adds, “We are 41 days to the Games and there will be many community engagement activities coming up. Our message is clear: “We are ready. Come support our Team at the Games.”

11\. SINGSOC has been actively engaging the public to be a part of the Games, whether by stitching an official mascot for a medal winning athlete or crafting a part of an art installation inspired by the Games. People from all walks of life have been busy getting ready and involved for the Games, to show our five million strong Kallang Roar come 5 June 2015.

12\. “It is an honour for residents and volunteers of Pasir Ris West Constituency to come together to cheer and show our support for the coming 28th SEA Games which also coincide with Singapore’s SG50 Celebration. This definitely brings joy and excitement for every Singaporean. I am sure Singaporeans will give their support and cheer for our local athletes, especially those who are currently residing in Pasir Ris West.” said Mr Ong Chee Keong, who is the Organising Chairman of Pasir Ris West’s SG50 Projects Committee.

13\. Beyond the Paint the Town Red initiative, other community events and opportunities for the community to come together to be a part of the 28th SEA Games include:

* The Songs of the Games contest  
* Nila’s Quest, a web and social based game  
* The Torch-Up! art installations across Orchard Road, Bras Basah, Marina Bay and Kallang  
* ActiveSG SEA Games carnivals  
* Community Sports Festivals  
* Carnivals at Kallang and Marina Bay during the SEA Games period
