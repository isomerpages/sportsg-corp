### **SportSG to regulate its Sports Centres' Operations to the prevailing haze condition**

Sport Singapore will regulate facilities’ operating hours at its ActiveSG Sports Centres according to the haze situation across the island to ensure the wellbeing of our guests.

Based on the 24-hour Pollutants Standards Index (PSI) provided by the National Environment Agency, Sport Singapore will close all its outdoor and non air-conditioned indoor sports facilities when 24-hr PSI level hits above 200.

Today (25 September 2015) as at 11am, the 24-hr PSI remained above 200. Thus, all outdoor and non-air conditioned facilities will remain closed to the public. Sport Singapore will assess and re-open these sports facilities when the conditions improve. Air-conditioned sports halls and gyms will continue to be open to public during this period.

We seek the public’s kind understanding and take necessary health precautions.

The health impact of haze is dependent on one’s health status (e.g. whether one has pre-existing chronic heart or lung disease), the PSI level, and the duration and intensity of outdoor activity.

Reducing outdoor activities and physical exertion can help limit the ill effects from haze exposure. Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention.
