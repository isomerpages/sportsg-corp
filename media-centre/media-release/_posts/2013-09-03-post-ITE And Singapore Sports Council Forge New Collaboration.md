**Singapore, 3 September 2013** - Some 1,000 ITE students will have the chance to be part of the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games - the region's multi-sport extravaganza - come 2015. To be hosted in Singapore, the Games will provide ITE students with the opportunity to gain real work experience and skills through industrial attachment and volunteering activities. These are made possible through a three-year Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and Singapore Sports Council (SSC) today. This is also SSC's first collaboration with an education institution in the planning and execution of the SEA Games.

2. The collaboration spells rich opportunities for students and staff, to work together with SSC on sports development and events. Besides collaborating to develop courses leading to sports or fitness-related certifications, the partners will also promote national and international sporting events, as well as conferences. Students interested in sports will have opportunities in learning the ropes in managing sports events when they serve industrial attachments at SSC.

**Benefitting from the Athlete-Friendly Education Scheme**

3. Student athletes will also benefit from the collaboration through the Athlete-Friendly Education Scheme (AFES). The AFES will lend support to athletes in their educational pursuits while training for high-performance sports in national teams. From creating flexible arrangements and providing guidance and mentorship, the attention given to these athletes will help ensure that they are able to balance their commitment to high-performance sports and studies.

4. On the partnership, Mr Bruce Poh, Director &amp; CEO, ITE, expressed, "We are glad to be part of the Singapore Sports Council's drive towards promoting sports in Singapore. Sports has proven to be powerful in bonding the student community, and galvanising character development and leadership skills among students. Our Colleges are well-equipped to stage international sporting events. We also look forward to the possibility of playing host to regional sports events, should ITE be selected as a venue."

5. Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, SSC, said, "Today's MOU with ITE comes at a very opportune time, just as Singapore gears up to host the 28th SEA Games in 2015. Welcoming over 7,000 athletes and officials to Southeast Asia's largest multi sports extravaganza is a massive undertaking. It will involve many hands to ensure the success of the Games, and it is with this in mind that we are looking to join forces with as many partners and interest groups. Beyond the SEA Games, I am confident that our collaboration on different fronts will provide significant authentic learning opportunities for the students."
