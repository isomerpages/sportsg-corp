description: Singapore, 24 June 2023 – It was a night to remember as the STEP
  Southeast Asia Youth Sport Leaders Camp (STEP SEAYSLC) 2023 drew to a close.
  Animated chatter and positive energy lit up the finale dinner at HomeTeamNS
  Bedok Reservoir and it was easy to see why. 130 youth sport leaders could
  hardly contain their excitement as the night progressed with creative
  performances centred around the Olympic values of “Excellence”, “Friendship”
  and “Respect”. Cheering on their teammates, the camp ended on a high note for
  the youth leaders with guest-of-honour Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture,
  Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law presenting awards to 12
  participants who demonstrated outstanding leadership.
