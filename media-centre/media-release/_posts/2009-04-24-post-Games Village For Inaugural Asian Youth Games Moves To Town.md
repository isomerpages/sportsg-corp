### **Games Village For Inaugural Asian Youth Games Moves To Town**

_Swissotel The Stamford Named As The New Games Village_

**Singapore (24 April 2009)** - The 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009 Organising Committee (SAYGOC) has announced that Swissotel The Stamford will now serve as the Games Village when Singapore plays host to over 40 countries for the first-ever AYG.

Swissotel The Stamford will house over 1,100 participants that are expected to take part in the Asian Youth Games (AYG). Centrally located, the hotel will be able to better support SAYGOC by providing value added services such as security support, language services, traffic control within the hotel and providing tour and travel arrangements for all AYG participants.

SAYGOC has been seeking alternative venues to serve as its Games Village following the constructive feedback received during the Chefs De Mission Meeting that was held last month. "Housing the athletes in satellite Games Villages has never been an option for us. With the insightful feedback received during the Chefs De Mission meeting, SAYGOC, after exercising due diligence, decided to move its Games Village to a centrally-located hotel, where we would be able to provide all participants with a more accomodating environment that comprehensively address our needs," said Chris Chan, Vice-President, Olympic Council of Asia.

"When we set out to find an alternative venue for the Games Village, we were seeking for a venue that would be able to accommodate all athletes under one roof. We want to provide the athletes with a complete experience taking part in a multi-sport event - the interaction with athletes from the various countries, the opportunity to learn each others' culture and forge friendships with their Asian peers. Swissotel The Stamford fulfills this important criteria. At the same time, its central location makes it an ideal base for the athletes," said Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer, SSC and Co-Chair of SAYGOC.

"As a hotel, Swissotel the Stamford has an added advantage - they have the experience of managing the inherent challenges that comes with accommodating large numbers of overseas guests every day. As such, we feel that they will be able to anticipate and better meet the needs of the AYG participants and officials," added Oon.

"I am pleased that the SAYGOC has taken the feedback made by several chefs de mission from the member nations into consideration. We are confident of a successful and enjoyable Asian Youth Games in Singapore," said Mr Wei Jizhong, Chairman, Sports Committee, Olympic Council of Asia.

The AYG, which will be held from 29 June to 7 July 2009, is set to feature almost 1,100 athletes across nine sports - aquatics (swimming and diving), athletics, FIBA33 (3-on-3 basketball), beach volleyball, bowling, football, sailing, shooting and table tennis.

**About the 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009**<br>
The Asian Youth Games (AYG) is an international multi-sports event held every four years to complement the existing Asian Games. The idea was first mooted as part of Singapore's Youth Olympic Games bid in 2007. On 3 April 2008, the Olympic Council of Asia's (OCA) Executive Board unanimously agreed to award the hosting of the first AYG to Singapore. This decision was backed by all 45 members of the OCA on 6 April 2008. The inaugural AYG, which is co-organised by the Singapore Sports Council and the Ministry of Education, aims to gather the youth from around Asia in a celebration of youth, sports and learning, where they will engage in friendly competition and imbibe the Olympic sporting values of excellence, friendship and respect. AYG Singapore 2009 will see athletes aged between 14 and 17 from 45 OCA member nations competing in 90 events across nine sports from 29 June to 7 July 2009.
