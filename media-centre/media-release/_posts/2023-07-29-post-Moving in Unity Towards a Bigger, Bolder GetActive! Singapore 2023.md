description: The GetActive! Singapore (GASG) 2023, the annual national day
  celebration through sport is back for its eighth edition, from 29 July to 9
  August 2023. GASG 2023 will see the addition of the Heartland Festivals, a
  partnership between NDP and Sport Singapore (SportSG), and the Majulah Fiesta,
  an event jointly organised by SportSG and Kallang Alive Sport Management
  (KASM). These collaborations will offer more sport try-outs, competitions,
  performances, and activities suitable for all ages and abilities, across
  selected ActiveSG Sport Centres and the Singapore Sports Hub, amongst other
  locations. The increased sport offerings will allow more people to participate
  in the festivities as the nation celebrates Singaporeâ€™s 58 years of
  independence through sport and active play.
