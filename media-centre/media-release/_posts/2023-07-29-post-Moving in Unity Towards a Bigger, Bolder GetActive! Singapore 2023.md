GASG 2023 will see the addition of the Heartland Festivals, a partnership between NDP and Sport Singapore (SportSG), and the Majulah Fiesta, an event jointly organised by SportSG and Kallang Alive Sport Management (KASM). These collaborations will offer more sport try-outs, competitions, performances, and activities suitable for all ages and abilities, across selected ActiveSG Sport Centres and the Singapore Sports Hub, amongst other locations. The increased sport offerings will allow more people to participate in the festivities as the nation celebrates Singapore’s 58 years of independence through sport and active play. 

The GASG 2023 launch held in conjunction with the Civil Service Club Public Service Sports and Family Day (PSSFD) this morning saw more than 3,000 people at the OCBC Square of the Singapore Sports Hub. In true GetActive! Singapore spirit, guest-of-honour Minister for Culture, Community and Youth & Second Minister for Law Mr Edwin Tong, Head of Civil Service Mr Leo Yip, Senior Management from Sport Singapore (SportSG) and Kallang Alive Sport Management (KASM) pedal-powered up stationary bikes to officially kickstart GASG 2023 and PSSFD.

“This eighth edition of GASG is special because this year is also SportSG’s 50th anniversary. We are celebrating these milestones with more play offerings at our ActiveSG Sport Centres in our heartlands as well as our Sports Hub, so that our community can participate actively and bond through sport. All these have been possible only because we have like-minded partners such as our NDP Exco, our new Sports Hub team and our purple army of Team Nila volunteers all working together. Beyond GASG, there will be more international sporting events, programmes and activities lined up, so do keep a lookout,” said Mr Alan Goh, Chief Executive Officer, SportSG.

Seniors’ Sports Day and Launch of ActiveX
Seniors’ Sports Day will return for its third edition on 3rd August 2023, this time with school children joining the seniors in the sport try-outs and playing reimagined kampung games such as Bola Tin Soccer and Bullseye Chapteh.

The one-day event will also see the launch of ActiveX, a new initiative that promotes active ageing as part of the Ministry of Health (MOH) Refreshed Action Plan for Successful Ageing and encourages intergenerational bonding through sport. Through ActiveX, SportSG hopes to connect seniors and youths to participate in sport-related activities regularly to promote a sense of belonging and nurture bonds which will in turn, create a self-sustaining support network.
