### **Introducing Frasia As The 1st Asian Youth Games' Official Mascot**

The name of the official mascot for the 1st Asian Youth Games (AYG) Singapore 2009 was officially announced today. FRASIA (pronounced as Fra-sher), which means, Friends of Asia, was chosen after members of the public were invited to participate in the "Name the AYG Mascot" Contest from 19 to 27 March 2009.

The winning entry came from Mr Michael Lye Quen Fong. The 55-year-old Singapore Airlines In-flight Supervisor's entry of FRASIA was selected after the panel of judges from the Singapore Asian Youth Games Organising Committee (SAYGOC) and the Straits Times felt that it represented the values and virtues associated with Olympism - friendship, respect and excellence.

Mr Lye said: "Together with my wife, Georgia, we brainstormed and came up with the name FRASIA during dinner. As Singapore is hosting the inaugural Asian Youth Games, we wanted to capture the essence of the Games with a name that will represent friendships forged amongst youths in Asia and I believe this is what the organisers would want to achieve."

Mr Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the AYG Steering Committee said: "FRASIA embodies the values and spirit of the Asian Youth Games. We aim to gather the youth from around Asia in a celebration of youth, sports and learning from where they will engage in friendly competition. FRASIA exemplifies a spirited representation of young hearts and minds in pursuit of sporting excellence."

The "Name the AYG Mascot" Contest was jointly organised by SAYGOC and the Straits Times. A total of 1470 entries were received, out of which Singa (Lion in Malay), Lion and Leo were some of the common names by the public. Some of the unusual names submitted were Sinyoglee The Friendly Cub and Bubbly Ago-go.

The contest also achieved its objective in engaging the Singapore community in the naming of the AYG Mascot. Students from Temasek Junior College, New Town Primary School, as well as children from the Jamiyah Children's Home and Beyond Social Service, were some of the organisations that participated in the contest. The Contest also saw the participation of 82 year-old Mr K M Foong!

For his winning entry, Mr Lye will receive a cash prize of $500 as well as AYG and 100 Plus premiums. A further 10 lucky draw winners will be receiving AYG and 100 Plus premiums for their participation in the Contest.

###### About the 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009
The Asian Youth Games (AYG) is an international multi-sports event held every four years to complement the existing Asian Games. The idea was first mooted as part of Singapore's Youth Olympic Games bid in 2007. On 3 April 2008, the Olympic Council of Asia's (OCA) Executive Board unanimously agreed to award the hosting of the first AYG to Singapore. This decision was backed by all 45 members of the OCA on 6 April 2008.

The inaugural AYG, which will be co-organised by the Singapore Sports Council and the Ministry of Education aims to gather the youth from around Asia in a celebration of youth, sports and learning where they will engage in friendly competition and imbibe the Olympic sporting values of excellence, friendship and respect.
