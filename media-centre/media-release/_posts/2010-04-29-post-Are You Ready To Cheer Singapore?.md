### **Are You Ready To Cheer Singapore?**

_Singapore Sports Council Unveiled First Cheer Song As Part Of Cheer Singapore_

**Singapore, 29 April 2010** - With less than four months to go before the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, Singaporeans have been urged to rally behind Team Singapore and make themselves heard at the various Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games competition venues across the nation through a new cheer song that was unveiled by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) today as part of its Cheer Singapore initiative.

2. Titled 'You Are The One Singapore', the song was specially composed and performed by local artiste JJ Lin for Cheer Singapore. An accompanying music video, with choreographed cheer movements was also launched. The music video will be aired on prime time television and will be made available over SSC's SingaporeSports.sg portal.

3. Revealed by Guest-of-Honour, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and Ministry of Transport, at a launch ceremony held at Velocity@Novena Square today, 'You Are The One Singapore' is the first out of a series of three cheer songs that will be part of the Cheer Singapore initiative. The SSC aims to have these cheers reverberate at all competition venues across Singapore immediately at all sports events and competitions, like the various upcoming test events leading up to the YOG, as Singapore gears up for the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games. Apart from using the cheer to encourage Singapore's athletes in action, the cheer also aims to get Singaporeans, as gracious hosts of the YOG, to actively cheer for visiting teams and foreign athletes. In essence, Cheer Singapore is a clarion call to action for Singaporeans to use their voices to provide support at all venues which will feature sporting competition.

4. The lunch-time crowd at Velocity@Novena Square was treated to a special performance by a flash mob performing the cheer song together with the cheer movements, which were specially created to accompany 'You Are The One Singapore'. The flash mob brought together almost 100 youths from across Singapore, who took the opportunity to teach the cheer song and its corresponding cheer movements to members of the public at the launch event.

5. "The Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games presents Singaporeans with the rare chance to catch our Team Singapore athletes live in action as they compete on home ground. The YOG will also bring more than 200 National Olympic Committees (NOC) and more than 3,000 athletes from all over the world to Singapore. This is the time for Singaporeans to rally together and be heard, in one voice and in one heart, as we cheer on Team Singapore and visiting athletes who will be in action in many venues across Singapore from 14 to 26 August. Together, we will make history," said Mr Kelven Tan, Chief, Sports Marketing Group, Singapore Sports Council. "In time, through Cheer Singapore, we hope to instil a spontaneous cheer culture among all the sports fans in Singapore who will make their support heard at all sporting events."

6. The three-minute long music video for 'You Are The One Singapore', which made its first screening at the event this afternoon, featured JJ Lin, together with Singapore sports icons Ang Peng Siong and C Kunalan, and Team Singapore athletes' swimmer Tao Li and gymnasts twins Nicole and Tabitha Tay. "The Cheer Singapore initiative is a fantastic movement started by the SSC to have Singaporeans lend their voices and cheer on the athletes who aim to bring glory to Singapore and their respective countries of origin," said Olympian and current national swimming head coach Ang Peng Siong.

7. Singaporeans will have the opportunity to learn the cheer song from the cheer motivators who will be heading to numerous locations over the next few weeks to encourage Singaporeans to learn the cheer song and its corresponding cheer movements. Members of the public can also look forward to learning the cheers through a series of Let's Play-YOG roadshows that will be taking place across Singapore from May onwards. In addition, to familiarise Singaporeans with the cheer song, it will be played before the start of S-League matches and during the half-time.

8. Part of the SSC's Let's Play movement, Cheer Singapore aims to use cheering as a way to get more Singaporeans to use their voices and to embrace a cheering culture, and to back our athletes as they blaze the trail towards the first-ever Youth Olympic Games to be held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August. Schools which are being twinned with visiting NOCs will also be able to use part of the cheer to back the NOC which they will be supporting during the YOG. Said Kelven Tan: "You are the One Singapore can easily be changed to either 'You are the One USA' or 'You are the One Malaysia'. The cheer is easily adaptable and we hope that as gracious hosts to the world, Singaporeans will embrace this cheer song and be part of the sporting action during the YOG."

9. The SSC hopes that through Cheer Singapore, a vibrant cheering culture will be developed in Singapore over time, in which a nation will spontaneously rally together and show their support for local athletes by cheering at events across all sporting arenas. The Cheer Singapore initiative was first launched by Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan on 20 March 2010 at the 1st National Cheerleading Championships held at the Singapore Expo.
