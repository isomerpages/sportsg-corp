### **1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009 To Leverage New Media To Engage Youth**

The 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009 (AYG) is set to break new grounds by employing the use of new media as its main channel of communications. It is the first multi-sport event to receive approval from the Olympic Council of Asia to provide broadcast coverage of all its sports events completely via digital channels.

To kick off this revolutionary move, the first Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009 Organising Committee (SAYGOC) has appointed World Sport Group and its partners Perform Group and Content Craft as its official website developer and web broadcaster. The appointment was marked with a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Signing Ceremony held today.

World Sport Group, Asia's leading sports marketing, media and event management company, will be working hand in hand with Perform Group to provide the technical expertise in the design, development and maintenance of the official website for AYG Singapore 2009. Content Craft will be looking into developing the necessary content to populate the website, including producing editorial pieces touching on the various participating nations, individual athletes and supporters and managing the live data and statistics from each sport event during the Games period. Besides being a portal for information on AYG, the website will also serve as an avenue to engage the youth community in Asia using new media initiatives.

In addition, the consortium will also be the official web broadcaster for all 90 sports events across nine sports that will be featured during the Games. This 'live' online broadcasting feature will enable supporters from all 45 participating nations to watch and follow the progress of their respective contingents through the official website.

Mr Oon Jin Teik, Co-Chair of SAYGOC and Chief Executive Officer of SSC said, "For the first time in history, a major multi-sports games will be using the new media channels as its main broadcast platform. The internet, a highly used communications medium used by youth, will be the gateway for the world to catch all the live action from their desktops, notebooks, mobile phones, or any other portable device that has a web browser. We are extremely delighted to have World Sport Group, Perform Group and Content Craft as partners in this historical initiative. For the inaugural Asian Youth Games, this will be another first in a long list of achievements as Singapore prepares to welcome Asia's youth. This initiative also provides a boost to Singapore's efforts to develop the sports media industry."

"We are delighted to be a part of the first-ever Asian Youth Games and this historic milestone in Asian sport. With our partners Perform and Content Craft, both market leaders in digital media services, we are committed to delivering a unique and interactive online experience that will educate, entertain and connect youth all across the region. Our goal is to create a web community that is driven by quality sports content and which is accessible throughout Asia. We look forward to helping to make the inaugural Asian Youth Games a huge success," said Mr Seamus O'Brien, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, World Sport Group.
