### **GetActive Singapore Returns to Celebrate Singapores 52nd Birthday through Sport**
There’s something for everyone at this year’s GetActive! Singapore (GASG) which takes place from 29 July to 9 August 2017. GASG aims to attract all Singaporeans to celebrate National Day with a spectrum of sporting activities across the island.

This year’s **_Active Enabler Programme (AEP)_** has seen even more quality proposals from the community. Registration for the National Youth Games, National Corporate Games and National Masters Games under **_Sport Competitions_** have also seen over 12,000 sign-ups across the 20 sports and 10 para-sports.

**Active Enabler Programme**

The second edition of GASG has seen many exciting event proposals put forth through the AEP, an initiative to support ground-up community projects through grants and endorsements. The quality and uniqueness of the events has gone up as a total of 291 events will be supported under the AEP.

With over 50 public events supported by the AEP to choose from, people can take part in yoga, high intensity workouts, outdoor adventure activities, and seniors-friendly fitness workouts. They can also join the record-breaking attempt to lift 52,000kg collectively in commemoration of Singapore’s 52nd birthday.

The Superhero mass walk at Sports Hub and a functional fitness routine for seniors at the newly opened Heartbeat@Bedok will also feature in this year’s GASG. The Bear Grylls wannabes can also pick up new skills by learning adventure life hacks and the basics of camping outdoors.

Modified sports events for people with disabilities will be held at the **_Inclusive Sports Festival_** at Our Tampines Hub on 29 – 30 July.

President of Outdoor Learning &amp; Adventure Education Association (OLAE), Mr Lye Yen Kai shared his thoughts on several of the organisations under the association being selected to be part of GetActive! Singapore’s Active Enabler Programme.

”OLAE is excited to partner GetActive! Singapore. It is indeed a meaningful platform for families and individuals to experience outdoor activities, especially when many may be trying outdoor activities for the first time. We hope that outdoor adventure will play a part in building an active Singapore and there are endless teachable and memorable moments in our activities.”
