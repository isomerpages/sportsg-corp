SINGAPORE (Singapore) - The draw for the [FIBA Intercontinental Cup 2023](https://www.fiba.basketball/intercontinentalcup/2023) was completed on Tuesday, June 20, and the six participating clubs now know the path to winning the trophy in Singapore where the tournament will be held from September 21-24.

The six teams were drawn into two groups where they will face each other in round robin style over the first three days of the 33rd edition of the competition. Sesi Franca ([BCLA](https://www.fiba.basketball/bclamericas/22-23) Champion), Team Ignite ([NBA G League](https://gleague.nba.com/)) and Al Ahly ([BAL](https://bal.nba.com/) Winner) will square off in Group A while Group B consists of Zhejiang Golden Bulls ([CBA](https://www.cbaleague.com/#/) Representative), Al Manama ([WASL](https://www.fiba.basketball/wasl/22-23/westasia) Champion) and Telekom Baskets Bonn ([BCL](https://www.championsleague.basketball/) Winner).

International stars Vlade Divac of Serbia, Chinese great Yi Jianlian and Ian Mahinmi of France were in Singapore to promote the FIBA Intercontinental Cup. While in town, they conducted a clinic for ActiveSG Basketball Academy and spoke to the participants.

The three players also participated in the Draw ceremony. They joined Toh Boon Yi, Sport Singapore Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Yazed Osman, Group Head of Events & Placemaking at Singapore Sports Hub, and Patrick Comninos, Chief Executive Officer of the Basketball Champions League, on a panel discussion on the growth of basketball in Asia and the global cultural phenomenon it has become.

"This edition of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup marks a new era for this esteemed tournament that already has a long and rich history. With six clubs participating for the first time and a fresh format, we are pleased to host this edition in Singapore and look forward to expanding and including more clubs in future editions," stated FIBA Secretary General Andreas Zagklis.

"We are pleased to showcase once again Singapore's ability to host top class sport events. Having the FIBA Intercontinental Cup on our shores is a testament to Singapore's exceptional event-planning expertise, as well as the opportunity to showcase our city as a travel destination. The FIBA Intercontinental Cup will not only demonstrate our dedication in promoting the sport, but also strengthen Singapore's position as a flourishing hub for hosting international sporting events", said Toh Boon Yi, Deputy CEO Sport Singapore.

"The Singapore Sports Hub has staged many unforgettable events, and we are honoured to be the first-ever venue in Asia to host this distinctive competition for the next three years, from 2023 – 2025," shared Yazed Osman, Group Head of Events & Placemaking at Singapore Sports Hub. "Basketball is an exciting sport that speaks to a wide audience and equally appealing is the iconic hoop culture. Basketball fans coming to Singapore can expect homages to all these and more."

All six teams will be in action on Sunday, 24 September, for the classification games. The winners of the two groups will battle to determine the 2023 Intercontinental Cup champion. The games and third and fifth placings will take place earlier that day.

The venue for all 9 games is the Singapore Indoor Stadium at Singapore Sports Hub.

Tickets for the FIBA Intercontinental Cup 2023 games go on sale on July 19 and ticket prices start from $10. Fans can register their interest on the Singapore Sports Hub website from June 20.

The Intercontinental Cup has included four teams in four of the last five years - only BCL champions San Pablo Burgos and BCLA winners Quimsa participated in 2021 - but the field has expanded to six teams for 2023, the most since eight clubs were in the field in 1987.

[FIBA and Sport Singapore reached an agreement](https://www.fiba.basketball/news/singapore-to-host-fiba-intercontinental-cup-under-three-year-partnership-as-competition-reaches-asia-in-historical-first) in March 2023 that the island nation will host the Intercontinental Cup for the next three years, expanding the competition to include Asian teams for the first time.
