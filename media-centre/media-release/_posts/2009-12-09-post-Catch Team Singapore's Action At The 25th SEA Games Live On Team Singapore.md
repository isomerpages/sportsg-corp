### **Catch Team Singapore's Action At The 25th SEA Games Live On TeamSingapore.Com.Sg**

_Live broadcast will be from 9 to 18 December 2009_

**Singapore, 8 December 2009** - Team Singapore fans and netizens can now catch Team Singapore in action at the 25th SEA Games, Laos Vientiane 2009, on the official Team Singapore website, teamsingapore.com.sg from 9 to 18 December 2009.

2. Apart from being able to catch the exciting 25th SEA Games Opening and Closing Ceremonies, the public will be able to watch selected live telecast as well as highlights of their favourite Team Singapore athletes in action, daily. (Please refer to Annex A for the schedule)

3. Live webcast is familiar to the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), having broken new grounds with the broadcast of the first Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009 on the official event website earlier this year.

4. "As the Internet and New Media become more popular; this platform of viewing sports has become more commonplace," said David Voth, Senior Director of Sports Marketing Group, SSC. "This is another way of bringing the athletes closer to home, as well as closer to their fans and supporters. Hence, no matter where you are, you will be able to watch all the exciting performances, cheer on and celebrate as Singapore takes home top honours at the 25th SEA Games!"

5. The Team Singapore website has also seen evolution over the last few major games. Earlier this year, Team Singapore launched its Well-wishing campaign for the 25th SEA Games where fans and supporters were able to submit their well wishes via the Website. The campaign also featured a new and exciting dimension - Singaporeans could keep track of where the well-wishes came from, through the map of Singapore on the Team Singapore website. In addition, the Team Singapore Well-wishing Road Shows saw messages of encouragement and support which were recorded on video and uploaded onto the Team Singapore website.
