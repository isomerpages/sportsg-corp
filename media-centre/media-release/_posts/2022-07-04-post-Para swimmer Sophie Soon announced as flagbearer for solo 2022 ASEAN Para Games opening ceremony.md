This is Sophie’s second appearance at the ASEAN Para Games after making her debut at the 2015 Games in Singapore.

“Being selected flagbearer is such an amazing honour that I didn’t expect,” said Sophie, who also competed at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games.

“I want to thank my family, teammates and coach for all of their support. I would not be in this position or be the athlete I am without them.”

**A mix of youth and experience to lead the way forward**

Singapore’s athletes will take part in nine (9) sports at the Games. There will be 16 athletes making their ASEAN Para Games debut.

The two other Paralympians who competed at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, Nur Syahidah Alim (Para Archery) and Muhammad Diroy Noordin (Para Athletics), will lend their major games experience to the Team Singapore contingent.

Dr Teo-Koh Sock Miang, President, SNPC believes that this mix of youth and experience bodes well for Singapore’s aspirations for continued success at major games.

“We have several promising athletes who are really looking forward to competing in their first Games,” said Dr Teo-Koh.

“The number of young, up-and-coming athletes in this Team is a clear sign that our para sport ecosystem – from talent identification at grassroots level onwards – is on the right path. the Opening Ceremony of the Solo 2022 ASEAN Para Games. I am confident that the contingent will do Singapore proud, inspiring others to pursue sports and follow in their footsteps.”

**Renewal of Athletes Achievement Awards**

These ASEAN Para Games will be the first major Games that will see a revised Athletes Achievement Awards, with the incentives higher than ever before.

The Tote Board and DBS are the primary sponsors of the AAA which provides a cash award to athletes who win gold, silver or bronze medals at the Asian Para Games, Commonwealth Games, and Paralympic Games, and gold medals at the ASEAN Para Games.

An individual gold medallist at the upcoming ASEAN Para Games will now be awarded $5,000 for each gold medal (cap at a maximum of three highest achievements) with gold medallists in team events and team sports being awarded $8,000 and $16,000 respectively.

"We are grateful to the Tote Board and DBS for recognising the efforts and performance of our para athletes,” said Dr Teo-Koh.

“The resilience that our athletes have shown in preparing for these Games have been nothing short of remarkable.”

**Health and safety of athletes of paramount importance**

In consideration of the ongoing COVID-19 health pandemic, the Singapore contingent will take additional precautions above what has been outlined by the medical committee.

The contingent will be issued with a travel essentials kit prepared by Sport Singapore and will contain items such as surgical masks, hand sanitiser, disinfectant wipes, Antigen Rapid Test Self-Test Kits and mosquito repellent.

"The safety, health and wellbeing of our athletes is our number one priority,” said Chef de Mission, Mr Low See Lien.

"It's about helping people succeed, so for me it's all about the athletes and the structures we can put in place around them to ensure they're supported and to optimise their performance".

I'm really looking forward to contributing to the success of Team Singapore as a whole.”
