Host City Contract and Commercial Rights Release Agreement Signing Ceremony held at Downtown East Singapore, 14 November 2008 - In about 32 weeks (227 days), Singapore will play host to young athletes and officials from 45 Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) member nations at the first-ever Asian Youth Games (AYG) in Singapore in 2009. The multi-sport event will take place from 29 June to 7 July 2009, and will be jointly organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC). The Host City Contract and Commercial Rights Release Agreement for the 1st AYG Singapore 2009 were signed today at a ceremony at Downtown East, which will serve as the Games Village. 

The agreements were signed by President of Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) Mr Teo Chee Hean; Vice-President of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), Mr Timothy Fok; and Permanent Secretary for Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), Mr Niam Chiang Meng. International Olympic Committee (IOC) Executive Board Member and Vice-President of Singapore National Olympic Council, Mr Ng Ser Miang as well as Mr. Husain Al-Musallam, Director General, OCA, were present to witness the signing ceremony.

Apart from the introduction of the official logo, the Singapore Asian Youth Games Organising Committee (SAYGOC) 2009, which comprises a Steering Committee and Executive Committee to oversee the staging of the inaugural Games, was also unveiled during the ceremony. Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Community Development, Youth and Sports, and Transport, will act as an Advisor to SAYGOC while Mr Ng Ser Miang will be the Chairman of the Steering Committee.

The Executive Committee comprising individuals from both the public and private sectors will be co-chaired by Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer, SSC and Ms Sum Chee Wah, Director, Education Programmes Division, MOE.

The AYG Singapore 2009 was part of Singapore's bid plan to the IOC for the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in 2010. Mr Teo Ser Luck said, "Singapore has created history by winning the bid to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games. As part of our bid submission for the YOG, we proposed holding an AYG in 2009 as a prelude to the 2010 Games. I have full confidence in the Executive Committee spearheaded by MOE and SSC. Their professionalism and enthusiasm will be instrumental in the staging of a successful and spectacular AYG in 2009. In addition, the experience gained from this Games, will be invaluable towards the organising of the YOG in 2010."

Mr Ng Ser Miang added, "The AYG Singapore 2009 will be the inaugural Games. It will leave an everlasting legacy for the youth of Asia. We are honoured that the Olympic Council of Asia has given this privilege to Singapore. SAYGOC will work hand in hand with the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee (SYOGOC) to deliver an outstanding inaugural AYG. We will also ensure that the experience gained and resources built up will be fully utilised to support YOG in 2010. I am extremely happy that MOE and SSC are jointly spearheading this effort. The full involvement of schools and students will help build a strong sporting culture in the school system."

The AYG Singapore 2009 will be the fourth multi-sport event to be hosted in Singapore. The other three events were South-east Asia Games in 1973, 1983 and 1993. Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO, SSC said, "As Singapore's leading agency in promoting sports, the SSC is proud to spearhead the organisation of the inaugural AYG in partnership with the MOE. We know there is much to do, but we are confident we can meet the challenges ahead and will showcase an exciting and memorable first AYG for both local and regional participants. This AYG Singapore 2009 will not only be about competition, but will be a platform to reach out to the youth through which they can learn about the values of friendship, respect and friendly competition."

Ms Sum Chee Wah, Director, Education Programmes Division, MOE said, "We are confident that the inaugural AYG in Singapore will have a motivating influence on our youths. With the gathering of young athletes from all over Asia on our shores, what we will see is not just the unifying power of sports at work. These youths will certainly be an inspiration to one another, as they experience the values of solidarity, cooperation, friendship and fair play, in line with the Olympic spirit. No doubt it will be an experience which our youths will appreciate greatly and will prepare them well for the YOG in 2010."

AYG Singapore 2009 will see athletes aged between 14 and 17 from 45 OCA member nations competing across nine sports: Aquatics (Diving and Swimming), Athletics, Bowling, Beach Volleyball, 3-on-3 Basketball, Football, Sailing, Shooting and Table Tennis.
