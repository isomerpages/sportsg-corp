<p><strong>Singapore, 28 May 2013</strong> - Some of Singapore's best sports
talent, event organisers and journalists move one step closer to bagging
the title in their respective nominated categories, as they were announced
finalists of the Singapore Sports Awards (SSA) 2013 today.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Starting out from humble beginnings, the SSA had just four categories
when it was first introduced in 1967. Today, the Awards has evolved to
become Singapore's most highly coveted honours for sporting achievements,
covering 12 award categories that cut across various facets of the sporting
ecosystem - from athletes and coaches to event organisers and media. Recent
additions include the "Best Sports Event (International)", "Best Sports
Event (Local)", and the "Most Inspiring Sports Story", which will continue
to be part of the award category mix this year. This progression supports
ongoing efforts to foster deeper relationships and collaborations in sport
across the people, public and private sectors, as part of the Vision 2030
sporting journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The SSA has come a long way. Today, it has become the event that athletes
and sporting partners look forward to every year, and more importantly
an accolade that is highly regarded by the industry," said Mrs Jessie Phua,
committee member of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) who is
also the Chairman of the SSA 2013. She added, "We will continue to review
and reinvent the SSA periodically, to ensure it remains relevant over the
years."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chairperson of the "Most Inspiring Sports Story" category Mr Ng Wei Joo,
Immediate Past President of the Institute of Public Relations of Singapore
and Partner of Tulchan Communications LLP, was heartened by the quality
of submissions this year. He said, "The stories submitted this year are
of a high standard, and that certainly made the judging process quite challenging.
We hope that through the Awards, journalists will be encouraged to continue
writing stories that inspire Singaporeans to live better through sports."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Said Mr Low Teo Ping, Chairperson of the "Best Sports Event of the Year"
category and Vice President of the SNOC, "The 'Best Sports Event of the
Year' award has found traction since it was launched last year. Through
the award, we want to recognise the efforts of event organisers and National
Sports Associations in making Singapore a vibrant sporting city with the
events they stage. These events have also in their own ways, contributed
economically in the areas of tourism, infrastructure enhancements and capability
development. Singaporeans are now able to participate in and watch different
genres of sporting action all year round. Having more international sporting
events in Singapore also showcases our offerings as a sporting nation and
this will continue to attract world-class entities critical to the development
of the sports industry."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The finalists for the Main Awards were selected by the SSA Selection Committees,
following which a secret ballot was carried out to choose the most deserving
winners. Auditing firm KPMG has been engaged to tally the votes and results
will be made known at the SSA event on 11 June 2013.</p>
