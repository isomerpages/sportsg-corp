### **More Race Officials To Return To The Track For 2010 Formula 1 Singtel Singapore Grand Prix**

_About 60% Of Race Officials From Past Two Races To Volunteer For This Year's Only FORMULA ONE Night Race_

**Singapore, 17 March 2010** - Over 950 race officials will once again return to the tracks of the world's only Formula One night race this year. The recruitment drive for race officials for the 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX ended on Friday, 5 March 2010 with over 1000 new sign ups.

2. The Singapore Sports Council (SSC), who administers the recruitment drive, is looking to sign on about 400 new volunteers to beef up its team of race officials. It will also be bringing on board about 20 new senior race officials who will be taking on the roles of Deputy Chief Pit Marshal, Deputy Sector Marshals, Starters, Deputy Chief Support Paddock and Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Meeting (Marshal Services). All successful applicants will be notified of their selection by end March 2010.

3. "We are heartened to see so many senior race officials pledging their support to the race once again. At the same time, we look forward to sharing our experiences of organising and managing the world's only FORMULA ONE night race with the new recruits who will be joining the race officials' fraternity. The success of 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX will only be made possible with the support of these volunteers who have committed their time and energy to be part of this significant event," said Kenneth Hui, Chief of Sports Facilities Group, Singapore Sports Council

4. "Major motorsport events such as the 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX provides race officials in Singapore with the opportunity to continuously hone their skills and build on their experience of being part of a world-class race. As we look towards hosting more motorsport events in Singapore, there is a need to develop capabilities of motorsports technical officials to support this growing industry. As such, we are looking at engaging more local officials to take on pivotal roles for this year's race," added Mr Hui.

5. "Despite the steep learning curve over the past two races, the volunteer race officials did Singapore proud with their dedication, professionalism and passion. This is definitely an exciting year for the marshals, with new rules, new teams, the return of world champions on the grid and for the first time, a Singapore-led marshal contingent that will run the show. The fact that many of the marshals are returning and we've received more applications than ever highlights the increased interest in the FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX," said Colin Syn, Deputy Chairman, Singapore GP Pte Ltd.

6. The 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPOE GRAND PRIX will see the return of some of motorsports' seasoned race officials. Gabriel Tan, Manager, FORMULA ONE Department, Singapore Sports Council will once again be taking on the mantle as Clerk of the Course in this year's instalment of FORMULA ONE's only night race. Joining him at the helm once again will be Michael Gray as the Secretary of the Meeting, Dr Kelvin Chew as the Chief Medical Officer and Janette Tan as the Chief Marshal.

7. In preparation for this year's race, some of the senior race officials will be involved in several training stints in Australia. Their first stop will be the 2010 Clipsal500 V8 Supercar Race Meet in Adelaide, Australia, followed by the Melbourne 2010 FORMULA 1 QANTAS AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX in late-March and SKYCITY Triple Crown, Darwin V8 Supercars Race Meet in June.
