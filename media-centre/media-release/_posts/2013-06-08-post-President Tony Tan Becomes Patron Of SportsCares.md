**Singapore, 8 June 2013** - It was yet another milestone for the Singapore Sports Council's (SSC) philanthropic arm, as President Tony Tan was announced as Patron of SportCares today. This announcement follows the roll-out of SportCares programmes that have transformed the lives of Singaporeans in need over the recent months.

2. Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer of the SSC, said: "We are privileged to have President Tony Tan onboard as Patron of SportCares. His endorsement is a testament of faith in how sport can be used as a force for social good. We are also heartened by the support we have received from corporate Singapore and individuals so far. SportCares will continue to link those in need with passionate volunteers and community-spirited donors. We hope to roll out more programmes that will help the community live better through sports."

3. The SportCares Foundation has been running sports programmes that provide skill-based learning, character development, educational support and life skills. The recently launched Saturday Night Lights (SNL) football programme, for instance, provides some 90 underprivileged and at-risk youth every weekend with free quality coaching, workshops, a nutritious meal at the end of the night, and transit home. SportCares also offers opportunities for underprivileged youth to participate in sport programmes run by partners. They include the recent OCBC Cycle Singapore and the upcoming Milo Youth Triathlon, football clinic with young Arsenal, and Real Madrid holiday camp.

4. SportCares has raised some S$1 million from corporates and individuals to date. It currently enjoys strong support from companies that believe in the power of sport to transform lives. Many companies agree that SportCares is a meaningful Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme for their staff.

5. Mr R Sasikumar, Managing Director, Red Card, said: "Red Card is always on the lookout to do more CSR activities and we are grateful for the opportunity to support SportCares. SportCares uses sport as a tool to do good with activities such as Saturday Night Lights and this is in line with our vision. The Canon Lion City Cup has united players from different nations and the involvement of SportCares further enhances the importance of sport for the community."

6. Ms Pollie Sim, Chief Executive Officer of Maybank Singapore said: "We believe in empowering disadvantaged communities through our corporate responsibility efforts. We supported SportCares as sports is a great way for the community to get together and is also an excellent platform for individuals, be it those with special needs or the less privileged, to achieve their full potential and aspirations."

7. Another donor was Running into the Sun, a concert promoter that recently designated SportCares as a beneficiary of the SM Town Concert. Managing Director of Running into the Sun Ms Beatrice Chia-Richmond said: "As concert organisers, we strive to put together high quality performances for music lovers, and being able to support SportCares with a part of these profits makes it doubly meaningful. I have witnessed Saturday Night Lights sessions and am inspired by the work that is done for these youths. To be able to contribute to this initiative is truly our great pleasure."

	
8. Mr Chris Robb, Managing Director, Spectrum Worldwide, said: "While selecting the official beneficiaries to join OCBC Cycle Singapore 2013, it became clear that the core values of SportCares are closely aligned to what we try to achieve through our event. Both parties strive to provide everyone, regardless of their age or ability, with the opportunity to benefit from participation in sports while also improving the welfare of Singapore's underprivileged, disadvantaged and disabled citizens.
As sport continues to establish itself in the nation's culture, I believe SportCares can provide a crucial platform to drive social initiatives through events such as OCBC Cycle Singapore."

9. Mr Adam Rahman, Managing Director, Head of Corporate Affairs, Citi Singapore, said: "Our approach to community development has always been more than philanthropy. We are heartened that our volunteers are able to contribute to the Saturday Night Lights programme as part of SportCares to help the youths develop good values and character through football. Since 2002, youth development has been one of our key priority areas in our corporate citizenship efforts. We believe that investing in the lives of youths offers one of the greatest intangible returns, and more importantly, it builds a future pipeline of leaders to benefit the communities that we serve."

10. Mr Lee Kok Choy, Managing Director and Singapore Country Manager of Micron Semiconductor Asia Pte Ltd, said: "Micron is delighted and excited to be a supporter of sports in Singapore as a means of developing and enriching our youths. We firmly believe that sound education and a strong community are vital to the success of both society and innovative companies, and through our partnership with SportCares we are able to make a positive impact through sports."

11. Players of the SNL programme were invited to play exhibition matches during the halftime breaks of the 25th Canon Lion City Cup from 8 to 16 June. Making their debut at the opening of the tournament today, the boys demonstrated their sporting talents and skills learnt from nine weeks of SNL fitness training, football coaching and leadership mentoring. Beyond displaying their football skills, the players also put their improved self-belief, teamwork and sportsmanship to the test during the game.
