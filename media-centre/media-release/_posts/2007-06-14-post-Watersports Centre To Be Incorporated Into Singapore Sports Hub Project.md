### **Watersports Centre To Be Incorporated Into Singapore Sports Hub Project**

The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today that a public watersports centre would now be incorporated into the Singapore Sports Hub project, at the site where the current Oasis Building is located. With this latest enhancement, the three short-listed consortia bidding for the project will be asked to enhance their tenders and submit their refined proposals incorporating the new requirements by September 2007. The successful bidder will then be selected by December 2007.

Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, said: "Integrating a watersports facility into the Sports Hub will create a vibrant, exciting one-stop centre for land and water sports, leisure and recreational activities. Members of the public can look forward to more water-based activities, like canoeing, dragon-boating and rowing, in the Kallang Basin and the Greater Marina Bay area."

Land in Kallang where the Oasis Building currently resides has been gazetted today for acquisition. The inclusion of the Oasis site will enhance the overall masterplanning and integration of design for the Sports Hub project. The Singapore Sports Council will be issuing a formal set of documents to the three Sports Hub bidding consortia on the additional requirements for the watersports centre. These requirements include having a strong community focus for the water-based activities, incorporating the needs of the relevant water-based National Sports Associations, and integrating the infrastructure and programming into the bidders' overall submissions. The consortia will be given ten weeks to refine their proposals and incorporate the watersports centre element.

Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO of SSC, said: "As a part of the Sports Hub, the watersports centre will provide the following benefits for Sporting Singapore: first, it will position Singapore Sports Hub as the world's first large-scale land and sea sports facility with integrated programming; and second, it will offer Singaporeans a new, expanded set of opportunities to play, watch, and enjoy sports. I am really excited to see a watersports centre being included as part of the Sports Hub."
