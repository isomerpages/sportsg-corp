### **Three Consortiums Short-listed for Singapore Sports Hub Project**

Three consortiums vying for the multi-million-dollar Singapore Sports Hub project have been short-listed. The three consortiums are Alpine Consortium (led by Alpine Mayreder Bau GmbH); Singapore Gold Consortium (led by Macquarie Bank); and Singapore Sports Hub Consortium (led by Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd). The three were short-listed from an initial list of four consortiums, which submitted their pre-qualification documents on 28 February 2006 (Refer to Annex A for the names of companies that participated in the pre-qualification).

The pre-qualification stage establishes and pre-qualifies bidders who demonstrate the expertise to execute the project. Potential bidders were pre-qualified based on compliance, eligibility, financial strength and technical ability.

The three short-listed consortiums will now move on to participate in the next stage of the tender process - the Invitation To Tender (ITT) - which will kick off in July 2006 and will see consortiums developing and submitting their proposals by December 2006. The successful consortium will be selected by the middle of 2007.

As a prelude to the ITT stage, the SSC will begin seeking feedback from the market on the project specifications within the next two weeks. Said Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO of the Singapore Sports Council: "Given the complexity and unique nature of the Sports Hub project, we are seeking market feedback on our requirements before issuing the ITT documents in July 2006. This would ensure that the eventual tender submissions in December 2006 meet our sporting needs for the future."

The Sports Hub will be a fully integrated sports, entertainment and lifestyle hub for everyone in Singapore. A unique cluster development of world-class sports facilities next to the city, it is the first and largest sports facilities infrastructure Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) project in the world and is also Singapore's flagship and largest PPP project of this nature. The 35-hectare development is conveniently located next to the city and is easily accessible to the rest of Singapore. It will be connected to the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network and major expressways.
