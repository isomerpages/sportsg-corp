### **Singapore's Top Sporting Achievers Honoured At Awards**

Gao Ning and Tao Li Named Sportsman & Sportswoman of the Year

Over 60 Team Singapore athletes and coaches received the highest accolades in Singapore sports for their outstanding performances in 2007 at Singapore's most prestigious sports recognition event, the Singapore Sports Awards 2008 this evening.

Receiving the top honours at the awards ceremony were paddler Gao Ning and swimmer Tao Li, who were named Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year respectively for their stellar performances at the 24th SEA Games in Thailand and other international competitions.

One of the high points in 2007 for Gao Ning was getting placed in the Top Eight at the Men's World Cup in Spain. This achievement came in the wake of victories for Gao Ning earlier in the year in the India Pro Tour, the Asian Cup, the Commonwealth Championships and the Austria Pro Tour. For the Sportwoman of the Year, Tao Li's achievements in 2007 were equally spectacular. She came in second to the United States Natalie Coughlin in the 100-metre butterfly event at the 12th Fina (Federation Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Melbourne (Australia). She also became the first (and only) Singaporean to ever reach the finals of the 50-metre butterfly event at the same tournament.

The Coach of the Year award went to Radojko "Raddy" Avramovic, whose national football men's team was also named Team of the Year (Team Sports) for their exceptional performance in 2007. The Lions kicked off 2007 on a high note when they retained the Asean Football Championship. Under Raddy's guidance, the Lions emerged as one of the region's football powerhouses, winning a bronze medal in the Bangkok SEA Games, Singapore's first football medal from the Games in many years. The Lions is currently being ranked 19th in Asia.

Guest of Honour, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), together with Mr Teo Chee Hean, Minister for Defence and President of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs, Mr Lee Yi Shyan, Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, Minister of State, MCYS and Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, MCYS and the Ministry of Transport, joined in the festivities in celebrating a year of sporting accomplishments for Singapore.

"Singapore sports delivered a sterling performance in 2007. Our Team Singapore athletes not only raised Singapore's flag high at the 24th SEA Games with a record medal haul of 43 gold medals, they have also made their presence felt at international events by climbing higher on the world rankings. All the winners of the coveted Singapore Sports Awards have truly epitomised Singapore's sporting spirit. My heartfelt congratulations to all the winners!" said Mr Chris Chan, Secretary General, Singapore National Olympic Council.

Also honoured at the event were the Sportsboy of the Year, shooter Jonathan Koh and the Sportsgirl of the Year, bowler Jazreel Tan, both of whom brought home a Gold and Silver medal respectively at the 24th SEA Games in Thailand. The National Table Tennis Women's Team, comprising of Li Jiawei, Wang Yuegu, Sun Beibei, Tan Paey Fern and Yu Mengyu were also given special mention this evening as the winner of the Team of the Year (Team Events) award. (For the complete list of SSA winners for 2008, please refer to the list at Annex D).

"2007 was indeed a stellar year for Singapore sports. Behind every award presented here today is an athlete whose tremendous courage, determination and perseverance have overcome numerous challenges in order to bring glory to Singapore. Their exemplary achievements have done us proud and will be an inspiration to young athletes," said Mr Oon Jin Gee, Chairman of Singapore Sports Award 2008, Organising Committee.

Minister Teo also presented the 2008 International Olympic Committee (IOC) "Sport and Youth" Trophy to the Ministry of Education (MOE) for its efforts in promoting a range of sports initiatives in line with the Olympic ideals for youths as part of a well-balanced education. MOE is the first Ministry to be conferred the IOC Award since the Awards' inception in 1986.

The Singapore Sports Awards 2008 captured the pinnacle of Singapore's sports in 2007, and signalled the beginning of another great journey for Team Singapore towards this year's Beijing Olympics in August.
