### **Fields of Dreams: A Tribute to the National Stadium**

The National Stadium is set to go out with a big bang, and tickets for her much-anticipated final event on 30 June 2007 will be available from tomorrow through SISTIC, priced at $15 for adults and $8 for children (excluding SISTIC charge).

Titled "Field of Dreams - A Tribute to the National Stadium", the closing event will feature a stellar line-up of activities that commemorate and celebrate the Grand Old Dame of Kallang - which for 34 years has given life to our aspirations, hopes and dreams.

From her stands to her track, dreams have been fulfilled in the pursuit of sporting glory, national pride and celebrating our common identity. And the stadium's long friendship with football has seen many a dream realised on her field - from representing one's country, scoring a winning goal, to raising a prized cup. And so it is fitting that football will play a large role in the closing event.

Take a walk down memory lane through an exhibition football match between veterans from Singapore and Malaysia. Featuring the likes of Quah Kim Song, Samad Allapitchay, Fandi Ahmad and V Sundramoorthy, the match aims to relive memories of the Malaysia Cup days when the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave reigned supreme and concession store runners hawked curry puffs, crackers and drinks on the stands.

The match will be followed by the highlight of the evening, an international friendly between ASEAN champions Singapore and Australia. With their maiden appearance in the AFC Asian Cup in July to come, fans can expect to see a quality contest between a Qantas Socceroos squad laden with European-based talents like Mark Viduka, Mark Bresciano, Tim Cahill and Harry Kewell against the Lions.

Says Steven Yeo, General Secretary of co-organiser Football Association of Singapore, "Football and the National Stadium have always been synonymous. From the Malaysia Cup, Singapore Cup to the ASEAN Football Championship, the Kallang Roar has been a part of Singapore culture. For the final time at the current National Stadium, Kallang will roar once again."

Providing the kits for the Singapore teams in both matches, sponsor Nike has produced two sets of apparel, including a Heritage Jersey for the veterans' match, as well as a commemorative T-shirt for the event. Both sets of apparel will be sold at the Singapore National Stadium at the event and will be available at Nike retail outlets from mid-June onwards.

"Nike celebrates this momentous event in Singapore's sporting history with our specially-designed Blue Heritage Jersey, which is reminiscent of Singapore's first national football jersey. These will be donned by our football veterans in the match between Singapore and Malaysia. In addition, we have also produced a set of commemorative t-shirts, available in both Red and White which reinforces our support for the nation's love of sports," says Magdalene Ew, Marketing Manager of Nike Singapore.

After the last ball has been kicked, the closing ceremony will commence, hosted by Brian and Mark Richmond. Many will remember the father and son team for their football commentary when matches were telecast 'live', and they will reminisce about their experiences at the stadium. There will also be a march-in featuring Team Singapore athletes, a song performance from Kit Chan, a ceremonial dousing of the flame and a fireworks & light display. Right after the closing ceremony, the "field of dreams" will be transformed into a giant disco with a dance party on the pitch.

Concludes Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO of co-organiser Singapore Sports Council, "It's going to be a night to remember. And we invite the public to come together, relive memories, and bid a final goodbye to the stadium. She has served us well for 34 years, and the entire event is a fitting tribute to close one chapter and open the next."
