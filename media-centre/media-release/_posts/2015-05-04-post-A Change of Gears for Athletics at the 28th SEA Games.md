### **A Change of Gears for Athletics at the 28th SEA Games**
Fans at the National Stadium coming to watch the SEA Games in June will see the unique sight of a remote controlled (RC) car zipping around on the field during the Athletics events. Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) and the 28th SEA Games Official Car, Volvo today showcased the scaled version of Volvo’s SUV, the All-New Volvo XC90, as the equipment retrieval unit for Athletics events during the 28th SEA Games.

The RC car measuring 90cm by 45cm and weighing at 15 kg will be used to collect javelins, hammers and discuses from the field of play and return them back to the start line. The use of the All-New Volvo XC90 RC car speeds up the process of returning equipment, allowing the next athlete to complete their throw right after. The car has special brackets with clips installed to hold javelins in place and a padded holding area with cut outs for the hammer and discus.

Mr Bob Gambardella, Chief of NOC and Sport, SINGSOC said, “The use of the All-New Volvo XC90 RC car is an innovative way to increase the efficiency of our processes during the throw events for Athletics. It reduces manpower requirements, and allows our officials time to prepare for the next throw, speeding up the interchanges between athletes. This is the first time we are seeing this at the SEA Games, and SINGSOC is happy to partner Volvo for this milestone.”

The All-New Volvo XC90 RC car is capable of reaching up to speeds of 100km/h and covering up to 4,000 metres a day. They will be operated by trained volunteers including those who have taken up RC cars as a hobby.

Ms Sabrina Sng, General Manager, Wearnes Automotive Pte Ltd (Volvo) added, “With Volvo as the Official Car of the 28th SEA Games, we felt that we could take transportation functionality to the next level. We are happy to contribute with this innovative solution that will enhance efficiency. We are confident that it will also add value to the spectators experience while supporting their athletes during the Games.”

The exterior design of the All-New Volvo XC90 RC car mimics that of its larger brother including the design of the T-shaped headlights which are inspired by the Norse God of Thunder, Thor’s hammer. This is a sneak preview of the highly anticipated All-New Volvo XC90 which will be launched in Singapore in end July.

For the 28th SEA Games, Volvo Cars Singapore will be contributing a fleet of 125 vehicles, comprising the Volvo S60, S80 and V60 in 1.6L turbodiesel D2 and 2.0L T5 variants, for delegates and officials. It will also run a special promotion whereby VIP and official cars will be open for booking at heavily-subsidized prices with discounts of $20,000.

Volvo Cars Singapore has also been actively involved in other major sporting events in Singapore such as the inaugural 2010 Youth Olympic Games, OCBC Cycle and Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore.
