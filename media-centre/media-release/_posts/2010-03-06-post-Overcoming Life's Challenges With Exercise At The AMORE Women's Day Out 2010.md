### **Overcoming Life's Challenges With Exercise At The AMORE Women's Day Out 2010**

**Singapore, 6 March 2010** - Led by Guest-of-Honour Dr Amy Khor, Mayor, South West District and Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, 4,000 women from all walks of life, gathered at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza today to participate in the Amore Women's Day Out (AWDO) 2010 - the country's largest women-only aerobic-based event. This year sees the largest group of women, from all walks of lives, gathering in any single day, since the event was introduced in 2003.

2. In-line with International Women's Day (on 8 March 2010), which celebrates the achievements of women, AWDO 2010 aimed to remind women about the importance of regular exercise and how an active lifestyle can help them in overcoming challenges and attaining greater accomplishments in their lives.

3. Eline Chua, Manager of the Adult Sport Development Division in the Singapore Sports Council said, "The benefits of exercise, whether physical, mental, or emotional, should not be considered in isolation. When you put the multiple benefits together, the result is a healthier, and more alert and refreshed individual, who has renewed strength to face the many challenges of life. Through Amore Women's Day Out, we want to remind all women in Singapore that while they are working hard to fulfill their many responsibilities, exercise should not be seen as a waste of time, but rather as a tool to help us achieve greater things in life."

4. Supporting AWDO 2010 was the Breast Cancer Foundation, which advocates awareness and early detection of this life-threatening illness. Many survivors have adopted a physically active life to help deal with the challenges of cancer. By taking part in AWDO 2010, these cancer survivors were able to show family, friends and fellow Singaporeans how regular exercise can benefit all women.

5. Wendy Tsai, breast cancer survivor and committee member of the Breast Cancer Foundation said, "When faced with an illness like cancer which threatens life, many people do not know how to react. At Breast Cancer Foundation, we take the time to participate in events like Amore Women's Day Out because we want to lead through example, and show people that life does not stop when obstacles get in our way. Continuing with our life and taking care of ourselves, both physically and mentally, will help us overcome these challenges in life and make us even stronger."

**Sporting Activities for All**

6. AWDO 2010 offered a variety of activities to cater to the different needs and preferences of the participants, whose age ranged between seven and 75. There was the Tri-Power Challenge for ardent exercise junkies, where participants were put through three consecutive hours of different exercise routines. But for exercise newbies, there was Experience Fitness + BellyBlitz Trial which introduced exercise techniques and workout routines in easy 20-minute segments. There was also the Power of 2 for mothers who wanted to spend time with their children. The Body.Mind.Soul segment catered to those seeking mental and physical stress reliefs, while Dance Beat, was for women who wanted to groove in style.

7. Jasmine Teo, Founder of Amore Fitness said, "At Amore Fitness, we continually seek to provide a wide range of exercise options, to show women that exercise need not be a dull and boring affair. We want to provide women with opportunities to find out that there are many activities around, which will cater to any type of lifestyle or personality. This is why we have always been supporting Women's Day Out."

8. Members of the public also joined in the fun sporting try-outs, such as archery, rock climbing, sports kenjutsu and uni-cycle. These activities were complimentary and were available on a first-come-first-serve basis.
