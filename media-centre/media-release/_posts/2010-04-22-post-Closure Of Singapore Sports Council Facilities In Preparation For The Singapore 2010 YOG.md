### **Closure Of Singapore Sports Council Facilities In Preparation For The Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games**

**Singapore, 22 April 2010** - In preparation for the first ever Youth Olympic Games (YOG) which will be held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010, several Singapore Sports Council (SSC) facilities will be closed to the public in preparation for the YOG. The schedule of the closures and the affected public facilities are listed in Annex 1 below.

2. Said Mr Fan Chian Jen, Acting Director, Sports Facilities Group, Singapore Sports Council, "The upgrades to our facilities selected as event venues for the YOG would allow Singaporeans to enjoy an enhanced sporting experience for themselves and their families at these facilities, and ultimately also promote familial and community bonding through sports. This is the legacy of the YOG."

3. The closure of the facilities for upgrading works marks the final phase of preparations as Singapore prepares to welcome the world for the YOG. "The inaugural YOG is an historic event and Singaporeans will have this unique opportunity to cheer our youth athletes as they compete in the international arena right here in Singapore and in the heartlands. As such we would like to seek the support and understanding of the public during the next few months as the preparation works begin and intensify at the various sports venues in the heartlands as we head towards August 2010," said Mr Patrick Lee, Director of Sports and Venues, Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee.

4. Members of the public are encouraged to continue their sporting activities at alternative SSC facilities which will continue to remain open during this period.

5. For details of other facilities which continue to remain open to the public, please visit the SSC website at www.ssc.gov.sg.
