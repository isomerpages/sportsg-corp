GET TO KNOW THEIR HOPES, DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS
"Team Singapore @ YOG" Photography Showcase To Be Featured At 20 Locations Nationwide Beginning Today

**Singapore, 6 August 2010** - To commemorate Team Singapore athletes' participation at the inaugural Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is pleased to present a sports photography exhibition entitled "TEAM SINGAPORE @ YOG", an inspiring showcase of momentous chapters in their pursuit for sporting excellence.

2. The showcase will be held at 20 SSC and NLB's Public Library venues in the five Community Development Council (CDCs) Districts (see Annex A), with each District featuring their respective resident YOG athletes. Through this, the SSC aims to have Singaporeans connect and identify with the athletes living in their community as they prepare to head into the competition proper.

3. "This Showcase drives home the point that our top youth athletes competing in the YOG are really ordinary Singaporeans driven by passion to excel in sports. You could have seen them around your neighbourhood, spoken with them or even live right next to one of them," said Ms Sharon Kam, Senior Director (Strategic Marketing), Singapore Sports Council. "We urge Singaporeans to rally behind and cheer on our national athletes as they compete to earn sporting glory for Singapore not only in the YOG but in all other Major Games, such as the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, and Asian Beach Games later this year," she added.

4. The Inspiring Sporting Singapore Photography Exhibition has been roving across various SSC and the Public Libraries in Singapore over the last four months featuring the Olympic values of Excellence, Friendship and Respect. It aims to reach, engage and inspire Singaporeans through sports photography and promote "A Sporting Singapore." It was launched at the Sengkang Sports and Recreation Centre on 2 May 2010 by Mr Charles Chong, Chairman, Government Parliamentary Committee for National Development and Environment and Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

5. "It is indeed a great honour to be a part of this Exhibition and to present these young and aspiring athletes to Singaporeans through photography," said Tay Ling, a professional sports photographer, whose contributions appear in this phase of the exhibition. He added, "I hope Singaporeans viewing this Exhibition will be spurred on to turn up at the various YOG competition venues to cheer our YOG athletes as they strive to deliver the performance of a lifetime."

6. Team Singapore track and field athlete Zachary Ryan Devaraj, who will have his photograph displayed in the North West District venues, said, "It gives me a huge boost going into the competition knowing that an entire nation is right behind us as we aim to bring glory to Singapore. The photo exhibition gives me an added boost to do nothing but my best for Singapore."

7. The Inspiring Sporting Singapore Photography Exhibition is part of the Let's Play movement, an initiative by the SSC to encourage all Singaporeans to embrace sports as a lifestyle choice, be it playing, watch, cheering or volunteering for sports.
