On 26 April 2023, the Local Organising Committee (LOC) has launched ticketing for the first-ever Olympic Esports Week (OEW).

The Olympic Esports Series 2023 is a global virtual and simulated sports competition created by the IOC in collaboration with International Federations and game publishers. The finals, held live this year for the first time, is one of the highlights of the OEW at the Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre.

The list of titles and sports are available in Annex A.  

Ticket holders will be able to experience a wide variety of games with a host of additional titles set to be announced for the line-up of exhibition matches. Visitors who are inspired by the Olympic Esports Finals and exhibition match action can also try their hand at selected games at the free-to-play zone. This will also be an opportunity to explore the latest innovations across virtual sports and gaming such as motorsport, baseball, cycling, cricket and more. 

Tickets start from S$10 per day and three-day passes are available from S$20, ensuring that more can witness the making of history and enjoy the epic competitions between some of the world’s best players.

The local organising committee is grateful to have the backing of partners whose visions and goals align with ours. We are all working hard together to ensure that fans, players and officials get to enjoy some of the best of physical-hybrid and virtual sport in June.”
