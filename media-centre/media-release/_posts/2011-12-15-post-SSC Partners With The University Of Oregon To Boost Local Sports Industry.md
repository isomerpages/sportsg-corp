**Singapore, 15 December 2011** - From Olympic medalists to founders of one of the world's most popular sports brand, the University of Oregon (UO) has them all. With a rich history in sports excellence and a leading role in the discipline of sports business, it is befitting that the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has embarked on a five-year partnership with the University to further boost Singapore's local sports industry.

2. The partnership with UO will aid in strengthening the skill set of Singapore's present and future sports leaders. It will also enable a more vibrant sports industry that in turn will contribute to the economy and sustain the sports delivery system. Championing this collaboration, Mr Richard Seow, Chairman of the SSC, and UO alumni said, "Through the MOU with the University of Oregon, Singapore has a great opportunity to improve the capabilities of our sports professionals working within the sporting industry. This MOU is very timely as Singapore embarks on a new phase for growth in the sporting sector."

3. The partnership with UO will enhance Singapore's sports industry by increasing the standards and expertise found in our value chain - of people, infrastructure, services and products. "With the construction of the Sports Hub well underway, we need to focus our efforts on developing the capabilities of our leaders in sports business and administration. As our events calendar accelerates with the opening of the Sports Hub, this group of professionals will align business realities and demands with the comprehensive recommendations from the Vision 2030 project," added Mr Seow.

4 The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which was inked today between SSC's CEO, Mr Lim Teck Yin and UO's representative, Mr Paul Swangard, Managing Director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Centre, aims to nurture a mutually beneficial partnership between the two organisations, specifically focusing on three main areas of collaboration:

* Providing local sports leaders with learning opportunities in the 'TrackTown USA' sporting culture at the University of Oregon
* Connecting local students to sports-related education and industry experience in Oregon;
* Giving UO graduate students the opportunity to work with SSC and local industry partners.

**Local Sports Leaders to be Exposed to Oregon's Sports Culture**

5. Oregon is home to some of the biggest players in the business of sports, the athletes at UO are regular features at the Olympics and World Championships, and the residents are ardent fans who come out in full force to support their sports teams. The sports culture and love for sports in Oregon is one that can be compared to few others in the United States.

6. This MOU opens up the doorway for the SSC to learn and identify just how, and what it takes to build and sustain such excitement for sports. UO will assist in facilitating meetings and engagements between delegates from the SSC and leading entities within UO and its partners in the global sports industry network. This includes companies dealing with sports properties, marketing, products, apparel and the media.

7. Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO of the SSC, said, "The training and development of world-class personnel is going to be important to the evolution of Singapore's sports scene. UO has a mature sports industry and culture, as evidenced through the extraordinary reach of both the TrackTown USA brand and the Oregon Ducks brand. This partnership will no doubt infuse more energy, efficiency and innovation in the development of our sports industry."

**Education and Industry Experience for Singaporean Students and Athletes**

8. "As Singapore's sports industry continues to grow, we need to create a pipeline of trained experts who are able to add value and continue to expand our businesses," said Mr Lim. "With the Warsaw Sports Marketing Centre at UO running the country's premier sports business programme, and with a highly regarded sports science faculty, UO is a perfect training ground at which to nurture the sports leaders and visionaries of tomorrow."

9. This MOU allows both parties to connect Singaporean students with educational and internship opportunities on the UO campus or with industry partners at an undergraduate, graduate or PHD level. The first batch of students from Singapore could be heading to UO as early as June next year.

10. Mr Paul Swangard, Managing Director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Centre said, "Sport is in the University of Oregon's DNA. We are honored and excited to be partnering with the SSC to share our expertise and connections with the emerging sport community. Our sincere hope is to help accelerate the development of the sport market in Singapore by providing the SSC and its partners with the knowledge capital and human capital it needs to fuel that growth."

**UO Graduate Students to Work with the SSC and Industry Partners**

11. Recognising the enormous potential for growth within Singapore's sports industry, UO is keen to send graduate students to Singapore on various programmes to explore the opportunities for collaboration, and implement sports initiatives.

12. From as early as June 2012, this collaboration expects to see a group of three to four students from UO's graduate programme arrive in Singapore for a 10-week internship, where they will collaborate with the SSC in areas such as athlete marketing, spectatorship, and other areas relevant to Singapore's sports development.

13. On his hopes for the benefits this MOU will bring to Singapore, Mr Seow said, "Building and strengthening the skills in the sports sector will enable a more sustainable and vibrant sports eco-system. We expect that this collaboration with UO will yield results that pave the way for better careers and higher standards of professionalism in Singapore sports."

About 1,400 international students from nearly 80 countries represent about 7 percent of the student body.

**About the Singapore Sports Council**
Formed in 1973, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is tasked with developing a holistic sports culture for the nation. The SSC creates opportunities for people to excel in sports; opportunities for people to be engaged in sports as, coaches, officials, volunteers or fans; and opportunities for people to do business in sports as sponsors and investors. The SSC has changed the way Singaporeans view and participate in sports. Through sports, we now have an enhanced national identity thanks to our sports participation programmes; greater national pride as a result of high performance results at international and regional games; and more diversified economic stability through our vibrant sports industry initiatives.
