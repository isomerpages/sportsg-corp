### **SingTel Pledges Over S$15 million For 28th SEA Games**

Singapore Telecommunications Limited (SingTel) today announced its contribution as the largest sponsor to date for the 28th Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games). As Official Multimedia Partner, SingTel will provide over S$15 million in next-generation multimedia solutions and technological infrastructure to support Singapore's sporting quest as host nation of the SEA Games, which is making its return to the country after 22 years.

2\. “It is our priority to provide next-generation multimedia services for major sporting events in Singapore, such as the inaugural Youth Olympic Games and Formula One®. SingTel has been a big supporter of sports, and mio TV has been bringing unprecedented live coverage of major international sporting events into the homes of Singaporeans. We are pleased to be the Official Multimedia Partner for the SEA Games next year, especially when Singapore will be celebrating its 50th birthday,” said Mr Yuen Kuan Moon, CEO Consumer Singapore, SingTel.

3\. Under the partnership with Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC), SingTel will provide end-to-end multimedia solutions to enable seamless connectivity and the smooth organisation of the Games at all venues. SingTel’s network capabilities will support an integrated games management system to coordinate and process data at the event.

4\. "In planning for the Games, we envisaged it to be the most digitalised Games in its history - one in which we can use technology powered by SingTel to augment game experiences and reach out to the entire Southeast Asia region,” said Mr Richard Seow, Chairman of Sponsorship and Marketing Advisory Sub-Committee, SINGSOC. He added that: “This timely partnership will not only allow us to capture, interpret and co-create compelling shareable content, but will also bring us closer to that vision with their comprehensive portfolio of service that is ever-so-critical in today’s working environment where speed and resiliency of data transmission is key.”

5\. Come 5 June 2015, Singapore will be host to over 7,000 athletes and officials from 11 Southeast Asian nations across 36 sports. SingTel will sponsor high-speed internet and WiFi capabilities to ensure all participants stay connected.

6\. SingTel will also be organising an exciting line-up of activities to engage the community and rally Singaporean’s support for Team Singapore athletes. It will lend its next-generation multimedia capabilities to enhance the series of roadshows, school engagements and public activities in the lead up to the region’s biggest multi-sport event. More details will be unveiled at a later date.
