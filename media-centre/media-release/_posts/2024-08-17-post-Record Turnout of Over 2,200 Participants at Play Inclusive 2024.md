<p><strong>, 17 August 2024 </strong>– The second day of Play Inclusive,
Singapore’s largest inclusive sport competition, kicked off at the OCBC
Arena this morning, where close to 500 participants, including athletes
and their unified partners, competed in five sports – 3x3 basketball, floorball,
basketball and football skills challenge, and soundball.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Play Inclusive 2024 saw a record turnout of over 2,200 participants, including
more than 1,200 athletes and unified partners, across two days, on 3 and
17 August at the Singapore Sports Hub. In 2023, 650 athletes and unified
partners were involved in the closed-door sport competitions. This year
is the first time the event was open to members of the public, where they
got to participate in inclusive sport tryouts such as blind running, boccia,
cycling, floorball, football, para athletics, shooting and wheelchair rugby
on 3 August 2024</p>
<p>Co-organised by SportCares, Special Olympics Singapore, and Singapore
Disability Sports Council, with the support of participating schools from
the Ministry of Education, Play Inclusive returned for its seventh edition
this year. The event fosters community inclusion by creating a platform
where friendships are forged and acceptance is cultivated through shared
sporting experiences, and is also a culmination of a three-month training
period for athletes and their unified partners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, Play Inclusive 2024 is held in conjunction with GetActive!
Singapore 2024 to bring Singapore residents across all backgrounds together
to celebrate National Day through engagement in sports and ultimately encourage
