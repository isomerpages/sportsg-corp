### **Sports Pioneers Honoured For Their Contribution Towards Building A Lasting Sporting Legacy**
_Singapore Youth Olympic Museum and Singapore Sports Museum officially opened at the Singapore Sports Hub_

More than 200 sports pioneers* were honoured for the years they have spent shaping Singapore’s sporting culture and identity, for the dreams they brought to the nation, their fighting spirit, commitment and passion which had, and continues to capture the hearts and minds of the nation.

2\. Amongst the sports pioneers who were present include 96-year-old Mr Gerald Clarke, a former hockey and cricket athlete, and who is also the oldest sports pioneer in attendance; Mdm Tang Pui Wah, Singapore’s first female Olympian in the sport of athletics; and Mr Robert Tan, a disability bowls sports pioneer.
 
3\. In his address, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Mr Lawrence Wong paid tribute to the pioneers’ contribution and service to Singapore and Singapore’s sporting scene. He said, “Our sport pioneers seeded the birth of our sporting nation. Back then, the support system and infrastructure for sports was much more limited. But our pioneers persevered against the odds, and blazed the trail for us. They gave it their all during competitions, and flew the Singapore flag proudly. Through their efforts, they inspired many young athletes who now dare to pursue their sporting dreams and passion. I hope that our athletes today will continue to uphold the never-say-die spirit of our pioneers, and scale even greater heights of sporting achievements.”

4\. Minister Wong also announced that all pioneer athletes, officials and coaches who have been a part of Team Singapore at Major Games will be offered free lifetime access to ActiveSG swimming pools and gyms. They will also be invited to major sporting events and programmes at the Singapore Sports Hub, such as the SEA Games and the ASEAN Para Games next year.

5\. Today also marked the official opening of the Singapore Youth Olympic Museum (SYOM) and the Singapore Sports Museum at the Singapore Sports Hub. The SYOM and the Singapore Sports Museum will provide opportunities for community bonding whilst allowing visitors to immerse themselves in Singapore’s rich sporting history.

6\. Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO, Sport Singapore said, “The Sports Museum is a place for everyone to visit. I hope to see families here; where kids can learn about Singapore’s sporting heroes and take back life lessons of sportsmanship, persistence and teamwork. I hope to see our next generation of sporting talent and student athletes here, where they are inspired by our pioneers to achieve sporting excellence. And I hope to see all Singaporeans appreciate our shared past and inspire us to work towards a shared future.”

7\. Said Mr Chris Chan, Secretary-General of Singapore National Olympic Council, “The idea of the Singapore Youth Olympic Museum was mooted before Singapore hosted the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010. I am sure that many sports fans and curious minds alike will be delighted to visit a place where they can discover and gain insight on the spirit of the Olympic Games, learn the Olympic values and be inspired to embrace, embody and express these values in their lives.”

8\. Mr Oon Jin Teik, COO, SportsHub Pte Ltd commented on the opening of the SYOM and the Singapore Sports Museum as another step forward for the Singapore Sports Hub and Sporting Singapore. “Today is a great day for both the Singapore Sports Hub and our sporting pioneers, who together have helped build a Sporting Singapore. For Sports Hub, we open yet another attraction to an already vibrant sports, entertainment and lifestyle destination. Situated around the OCBC Square, we have the Sports Hub Library, Shimano Cycling World, Kallang Wave Mall and now proudly unravel the Singapore Youth Olympic Museum and Singapore Sports Museum to sit among our lifestyle offerings,” he said.

9\. Previously located at Kay Siang Road, the new entirely redesigned SYOM features Singapore’s journey in hosting the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010. Meanwhile, the Singapore Sports Museum has six galleries that each takes a look at the various dimensions of sport in Singapore. For example, the “Dream Venue” gallery pays tribute to the former National Stadium, with actual artefacts and memorabilia from iconic events in its 37-year history. Its ‘Hear Kallang Roar’ exhibition, a project supported by the irememberSG Fund for the Singapore Memory Project as part of SG50, showcases key highlights of Singapore football from its time when the National Stadium was home to the Lions.

\*Our sports pioneers are members of the pioneer generation who had represented Singapore at any of the Major Games (SEA Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic Games), either as athletes, or officials and coaches.
