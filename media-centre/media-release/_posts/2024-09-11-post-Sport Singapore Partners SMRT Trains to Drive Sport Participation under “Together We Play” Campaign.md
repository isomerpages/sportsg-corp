<p><strong>Singapore, 11 September 2024</strong> – As part of a concerted
effort to bring sport closer to Singaporeans, Sport Singapore (SportSG)
together with SMRT Trains piloted a series of free ActiveSG x SMRT Zumba
workout sessions at Esplanade MRT station this week. The sessions take
place on Monday evenings from 7:00pm to 8:00pm, spanning nine weeks from
9 September to 4 November 2024 (refer to Annex A<strong><em> </em></strong>for
more details).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Driving Sport Participation through Shared Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>This initiative is part of an ongoing campaign aimed at encouraging Singaporeans
to enjoy time together and bond with their loved ones through sport and
exercise. Titled “Together We Play”, the campaign harnesses the power of
sport in building camaraderie, inclusivity and a shared identity - be it
among family members, friends, colleagues or communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Alan Goh, Chief Executive Officer, SportSG</strong> said, “Sport
participation in Singapore is among the highest in the world, and we certainly
want this to continue. At the same time, we acknowledge that Singaporeans
have other important commitments such as work and taking care of their
family. The “Together We Play campaign” is our way of reminding everyone
that playing sport together is a great way of spending quality time with
our loved ones. Reaping the benefits of sport is an added bonus!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regular sport participation in Singapore (participation of at least once
a week across all ages) crossed the 70% mark in 2021, as reported in SportSG’s
annual National Sport &amp; Exercise Participation Survey (NSPS). While
the percentage remained high in 2023, regular sport participation among
adults aged 20 to 59 and seniors aged 60 and above dipped slightly as they
returned to work and other commitments post-COVID restrictions. Working
adult respondents cited taking care of family (31%), working overtime (28%)
and lack of motivation to exercise (19%) as top barriers to regular sport
participation. These findings guided the design of the “Together We Play”
campaign, with the aim of driving regular sport participation among young
adults (refer to Annex B for a snapshot of some topline findings from the
2023 NSPS).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>“</strong>We have been coming up with innovative ways to bring
sport closer to everyone, particularly our working adults. This includes
looking at how we can seamlessly integrate sport into their daily commute
or when they transit between activities. Through our partnership with SMRT
Trains, we look forward to bringing more sporting activities to Singaporeans
even while people are on the go, and in doing so further enliven our transport
nodes. We also hope that this will also pave the way for more corporates
and other organisations to join us in helping Singaporeans <em>live better through sport</em>,”
added Mr Goh.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Lam Sheau Kai, President, SMRT Trains</strong>, said: “We are
excited to partner SportSG to bring more vibrancy to our rail network through
the ActiveSG x SMRT Zumba Workout sessions. Aligned with our vision of
‘Moving People, Enhancing Lifestyles,’ we view our MRT stations as more
than just transit points. These public spaces within the SMRT network can
foster community interaction, engagement, and personal well-being. As part
of the Communities in Station programme, which aims to strengthen ties
with the communities around our network and enhance the commuting experience,
initiatives like these workout sessions, alongside amenities such as the
table tennis table at Esplanade MRT station and blood pressure monitors
at Tanjong Pagar and Promenade MRT stations, exemplify our commitment to
creating vibrant and integrated environments for all.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Together We Play Interactive Running Game</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the campaign, SportSG has also rolled out an interactive running
game to show citizens that there are fun and easy ways to get active. The
game, which can be played in either a single- or two-player mode, involves
running for 60 seconds in front of a large screen to propel one’s avatar
forward. Players are to collect as many “tokens” as possible, for a chance
to qualify for a monthly lucky draw to win $100 worth of e-vouchers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The interactive running game is currently at the following locations:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Active Health Lab @ Decathlon Singapore Lab (Kallang), until 31 December
2024</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kallang Wave Mall (near exit of FairPrice Xtra), until 30 September 2024</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>More locations will be announced in the coming months.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Singaporeans of all ages and abilities can continue to enjoy
a diverse range of sporting experiences islandwide. For more information
