<p><strong>Singapore, 16 February 2024</strong> – The national cricket team
will begin training at West Coast Ground by mid-2024. This new cricket
training ground will be a dedicated training facility for the National
Team to prepare for major competitions, which may include SEA Games, Asian
Games and ICC ranking competitions.</p>
<p>The West Coast Ground will have a cricket pitch, cricket nets, gym and
sheltered training area. The sheltered training area will allow the team
to train even in rainy weather.</p>
<p>This latest development is part of a close partnership between Sport Singapore
(SportSG) and the Singapore Cricket Association (SCA) since 2016 to ensure
that the training needs of Team Singapore cricketers are met. This new
space was secured following active discussions with various government
agencies. Together with the Ministry of Culture, Community &amp; Youth,
SportSG drove discussions with Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and People’s
Association to explore how our Team Singapore cricketers could have the
training space needed. Discussions to secure the West Coast Ground, a former
National League venue, began in earnest in July 2023 and through SLA’s
facilitation, this site was confirmed in November 2023.</p>
<p>SportSG had earlier also actively negotiated a facility sharing agreement
between SCA, the Singapore Indian Association and Ceylon Sport Club for
our national cricketers to train at Balestier Plain. This enabled them
to have a training facility from March 2023 till date.</p>
<p>“It is a challenge to find adequate space for field sports, given the
land constraint we face in Singapore. The national cricket team’s training
regimen and schedule requires a dedicated space that is conducive for training.
We appreciate the strong support from Ministry of Culture, Community &amp;
Youth and Sport Singapore in this journey – from negotiating for earlier
shared facility arrangement at Balestier Plain to their quick action in
helping us secure the lease at West Coast Ground,” said Mahmood Gaznavi,
President of SCA. “From the moment Singapore Cricket Association shared
our requirements and challenges with Minister Edwin Tong, there had been
prompt and timely developments culminating in the West Coast Ground being
allocated to cricket.”</p>
<p>SportSG takes a long-term view in planning for spaces to give Singaporeans
good access to quality sport facilities as well as support the training
needs of our Team Singapore athletes in land-scarce Singapore, under the
Sports Facilities Master Plan.</p>
<p>Beyond supporting our Team Singapore athletes and National Sport Associations’
need for training space, the Associations also receive various other support.
Dr Su Chun Wei, Chief of Singapore Sport Institute, said, “Sport Singapore
works closely with National Sports Associations including the Singapore
Cricket Association to develop their sport in Singapore and support our
Team Singapore athletes. We provide the Singapore Cricket Association with
annual funding support which it uses for training facilities, development
programmes, and local and overseas training and competitions for our national
athletes. The athletes also have access to sport science and sport medicine
support. We look forward to the national cricketers’ continued achievements
in the international arena in the coming years.”</p>
