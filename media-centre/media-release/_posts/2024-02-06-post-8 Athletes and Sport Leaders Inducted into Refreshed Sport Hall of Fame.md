<p>The Singapore Sport Hall of Fame was refreshed in 2023 to include a new
category for sport leaders, and to recognise the achievements of athletes
beyond medals, including contributions back to sport and the community.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 6 February 2024 </strong>– Eight sport figures - including
three athletes and five sport leaders - were inducted into the Singapore
Sport Hall of Fame at the Istana today. The Sport Hall of Fame celebrates
the exceptional achievements and contributions of Singapore’s sporting
heroes, and it is the first time sport leaders are receiving this prestigious
recognition since its inception in 1985.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Sport Hall of Fame was refreshed in 2023 to recognise outstanding
individuals who have contributed to the overall development of Singapore
sports, with the aim to inspire others in the sporting ecosystem to look
to these inductees as role models and uplift Singapore as a sporting nation.
A new category for sport leaders was thus introduced to recognise the service
of those behind the scenes, including sport administrators, coaches and
scientists. The revised athlete category now recognises those who demonstrate
sustained contributions back to the sport or community, after retiring
from active competition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Guest-of-Honour <strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, President, Republic of Singapore</strong>,
said, “Each of the eight Singaporeans inducted to the Sport Hall of Fame
today have contributed greatly - and often beyond the traditional realms
of athleticism, through their leadership and the way they have inspired
many others. Together as One Team Singapore, let’s continue to strengthen
the Singapore spirit through sport.”</p>

can be found in <u>Annex A (athletes)</u> and <u>Annex B (sport leaders)</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Joscelin Yeo, Singapore Sport Hall of Fame Awardee (Athlete) and former Team Singapore swimmer</strong>,
said, “I am deeply honoured and humbled to receive this prestigious award
today, standing alongside esteemed sporting figures who have left an indelible
mark on Singapore's sporting legacy. Singapore was built on the shoulders
of giants and while I don’t consider myself to be one, I believe that much
can be learnt from those who have gone before us, and I endeavour to do
what I can in that respect. Sports, in particular swimming, has taught
me a lot of life lessons, hence I hope to see sports as a greater enabler
and equaliser - uniting Singaporeans and bringing hope to the community.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mrs Jessie Phua, Singapore Sport Hall of Fame Awardee (Sport Leader) and former President of the Singapore Bowling Federation</strong>,

in the sporting community began in 2002, when I stepped up to the challenge
of revitalising bowling in Singapore. Today, the Singapore bowling team
is a global powerhouse - recognised and respected worldwide - and this
would not have been possible without the dedicated team at the Singapore
Bowling Federation, who worked alongside me to rebuild the sport. My message
to the other sport leaders - follow your heart, take time to understand
what’s best for your sport and athletes, and make decisions based on that.
This formula worked for bowling, and I hope it will resonate across other
sports too."</p>
