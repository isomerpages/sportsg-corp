<p><strong>Singapore, 28 March 2025 – </strong>FIBA and Sport Singapore (SportSG)
announced today the extension of their existing partnership to host a series
of events in 2026 and 2027 – marking concrete steps to grow the profile
of 3x3 basketball within the local sporting community. The announcement
took place at the opening ceremony of the FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup 2025 earlier
this evening, with Mr Alex Sanchez, FIBA 3x3 Managing Director, presenting
a token to Mr Kon Yin Tong, Chairman of Sport Singapore (SportSG), to symbolise
this milestone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3x3 basketball fans can look forward to major events in the next two years,
including FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup in April 2026, FIBA 3x3 World Cup Qualifier
in April 2026, and FIBA 3x3 World Cup in June 2027.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The FIBA 3x3 World Cup Qualifier 2026, taking place right after FIBA 3x3
Asia Cup 2026 in Singapore Sports Hub, will attract more than 24 teams
vying to qualify for the 2026 edition of the FIBA 3x3 World Cup. The following
year, FIBA 3x3 World Cup in 2027 is expected to welcome 40 teams from around
the world over a seven-day event. More details about the event venue for
FIBA 3x3 World Cup in 2027 will be shared in due course.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Alex Sanchez, FIBA 3x3 Managing Director,
said: “We are incredibly excited and fortunate to have such strong partners
in Singapore, who share our passion for 3x3 basketball and the delivery
of world-class events. The Singapore Sports Hub, a renowned venue for major
sporting events, will provide the perfect setting to host the FIBA 3x3
Asia Cup and the 3x3 World Cup Qualifiers in 2026. As we gear up to welcome
the best players for the final FIBA 3x3 World Cup before the LA28 Olympics,
we are confident that Singapore will deliver beyond our expectations.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, Singapore’s men’s and women’s teams’ world rankings stand at 31
and 19 respectively, establishing them within the top five in Asia. Singapore
has hosted four consecutive editions of FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup, three of which
were held at the Singapore Sports Hub, and attendance has seen a year-on-year
20% increase since 2023.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Alan Goh, CEO of SportSG, said, “Our partnership with FIBA has brought
world-class basketball action to Singapore where our community can both
watch and participate in the sport. Since 2022, the FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup has
grown into a marquee event that draws hundreds of spectators – from our
enthusiastic school children to our passionate fans from our basketball
community. Extending our partnership with FIBA through 2026 and 2027 reflects
the popularity of basketball as one of our most popular team sports in
Singapore. With these marquee tournaments alongside our grassroots basketball
programmes, we aim to benefit our TeamSG basketball players while also
ensuring that basketball remains accessible as a sport for all in Singapore.”</p>
<p>Quek Swee Kuan, CEO of Kallang Alive Sport Management, shared, “Basketball
has become a mainstay of Singapore Sports Hub’s vibrant sporting calendar.
We are thrilled to welcome the crowd-favourite FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup back in
2026 and honoured to also organise the FIBA 3x3 World Cup Qualifiers next
year, the first time the event is being held in Singapore. We look forward
to building on this momentum - curating accessible programming and creating
unforgettable experiences for athletes and the basketball community - and
cementing the Singapore Sports Hub as a preferred destination for international
sporting events.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>This extended partnership between FIBA and SportSG aims to further grow
interest in the sport and establish Singapore as a regional hub for basketball.
With over 1,100 basketball courts across the island, there are ample opportunities
for communities to bond, play, and strengthen basketball’s popularity as
one of the top team sports among Singaporeans.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond major international tournaments, Singapore has built a strong basketball
ecosystem that engages players of all ages. The ActiveSG Basketball Academy
continues to nurture young talent, attracting over 2,000 youth participants
each season, while the community-league ActiveSG Cup attracted approximately
5,500 players across 10 age groups in 2024. Pesta Sukan, Singapore’s annual
community multi-sport festival, saw more than 600 teams competing last
year, demonstrating the sport’s growing popularity.</p>
<p>These efforts are a testament to SportSG’s efforts to raise the profile
of basketball and grow our talent pool. Together with major events such
as the upcoming NBA Rising Stars Invitational in June and FIBA Intercontinental
Cup in September, Singapore’s reputation as a basketball powerhouse will
be further cemented. Through these efforts, SportSG continues to ensure
that basketball in Singapore remains accessible, vibrant, and competitive
at all levels.</p>
<p></p>

Local and international fans can look forward to an exciting calendar of
basketball events, underscoring Singapore’s continued investment in the
