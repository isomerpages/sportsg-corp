### **An extraordinary welcome to the 8th ASEAN Para Games**

Ten flags were raised and hoisted at the Event Plaza @ Marina Bay Sands today as part of the Team Welcome Ceremony for the 8th ASEAN Para Games.

Facing Singapore’s iconic CBD skyline, the national anthems of all ten nations resounded throughout Marina Bay today as Singapore welcomed the chef de missions, team officials and athletes who will be participating in the first ever ASEAN Para Games to be held in Singapore.

In his welcome speech, Chairman of Singapore ASEAN Para Games Organising Committee (SAPGOC) EXCO, Mr Lim Teck Yin highlighted the theme and vision of the 8th ASEAN Para Games. “The theme, ‘Celebrate the Extraordinary’ is about connecting individuals, communities and countries in our region to our dreams. It is beyond competing, winning or even overcoming defeat. It is about inspiring the one that is inside each of us, and then going on to inspire those around us. Each of us has a story to tell. Stories of struggle and triumph; stories of pain or loss, and stories of profound joy and peace. Our stories are the vision of the 8th ASEAN Para Games.”

The 8th ASEAN Para Games will be held from 3 to 9 December 2015.
