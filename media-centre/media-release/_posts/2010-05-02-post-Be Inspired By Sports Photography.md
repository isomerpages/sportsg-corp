### **Be Inspired By Sports Photography**

Four-month Long Exhibition Across Singapore Aims To Bring The Drama Of Sports Photography To The Heartlands

**Sunday 2 May 2010** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has launched the Inspiring Sporting Singapore Photography Exhibition in support of the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games (YOG). Declared open at the Sengkang Sports and Recreation Centre, one of the venues of the exhibition this morning by Mr Charles Chong, Chairman, Government Parliamentary Committee for National Development and Environment and Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, the exhibition aims to reach out to members of the public who visit the SSC's Sports and Recreation Centres (SRCs) and the NLB's Public Libraries, and will culminate in a showcase of Singapore's young athletes who will be participating in the YOG.

2. Said Mr Kelven Tan, Chief, Sports Marketing Group, Singapore Sports Council, "With its ability to tell a compelling story, immortalise the raw drama and emotions of sports, and to capture the hearts and minds of the people, sports photography is considered one of the most popular forms of photography today."

3. The Inspiring Sporting Singapore Photography Exhibition will be rolled out in three phases* over a four-month period and will feature the Olympic values of Excellence, Friendship and Respect. It targets to reach, engage and inspire Singaporeans through sports photography and to promote A Sporting Singapore. Visitors to the exhibitions can expect to see some familiar faces in the exhibits, including photographs of a few Team Singapore athletes who delivered sterling performances at the 25th SEA Games in Vientiane, Laos held in December 2009.

4. Added Mr Tan, "We hope telling these stories will rouse the sporting spirit of Singaporeans and rally them behind our YOG athletes to cheer them on as they blaze the trail and prepare to deliver a performance of a lifetime in the YOG and gain Olympic glory for Singapore."

5. Singaporean freelance photographer John Heng, who will have a selection of his photographs displayed during the Inspiring Sporting Singapore Photography Exhibition, said "Sports photography has given me the privilege of being right in the forefront of the playing field where the action is."

6. "It allows me to capture the indomitable human spirit as they aim for triumph, but more importantly, it gives me a chance to be able to share it with others in the hope that they in turn would be similarly inspired," added Mr Heng.
