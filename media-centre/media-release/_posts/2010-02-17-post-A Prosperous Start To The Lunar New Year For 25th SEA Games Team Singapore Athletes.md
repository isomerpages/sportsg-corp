### **A Prosperous Start To The Lunar New Year For 25th SEA Games Team Singapore Athletes At The Map Awards**

**Singapore, 17 February 2010** - Team Singapore's highly successful 25th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games contingent gathered tonight at the Fairmont Singapore for a Chinese New Year-inspired Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP) Awards and Appreciation Dinner to celebrate their exceptional performance at the Games. The contingent returned from the 25th SEA Games in Vientiane, Laos, last December with an impressive medal haul of 98 medals (33 Gold, 30 Silver and 35 Bronze) despite the nation sending in its smallest contingent for the SEA Games.

2. Keeping to the Chinese New Year tradition, the event was kicked off with a special lion dance to greet the Guest-of-Honour, Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Defence and President of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC). Also present at the celebrations were Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, along with coaches, officials, partners and sponsors.

3. The Year of the Tiger will prove to be a challenging and exciting year for Team Singapore, with several major games such as the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, 16th Asian Games Guangzhou 2010 and Commonwealth Games Delhi 2010 lined up till the end of the year. To usher in good luck and prosperity for Team Singapore in the Year of the Tiger, a "lo-hei" ceremony was held as part of the celebrations tonight.

4. Continuing the theme of the evening, DPM Teo presented the MAP awards, totalling $455,000, to the 25th SEA Games medallists and record breakers in red packets. This is the first time that athletes are being rewarded for breaking the SEA Games records. The MAP awards are sponsored by Tote Board and Singapore Pools.

5. "Tonight, we have laid out a dinner for Team Singapore, starting with the traditional "Lo Hei" to usher in good fortune and success for the Lunar New Year. As you know the year ahead will be a busy one, with the Youth Olympic Games in August, the Commonwealth Games in October and the Asian Games in November. Success comes only from commitment and hard work. But for the moment let us celebrate our team's success at the SEA Games with the awards and the appreciation dinner. May this be an inspiration and encouragement for greater success this year," said Guest of Honour, Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Defence and President, Singapore National Olympic Council.

6. The biggest winner of the evening was the Singapore swimming team, who were the top performers at the 25th SEA Games, contributing a total of 33 medals to the medal tally. Singapore's gold medallists from the swimming team received a total of $200,000 tonight for their 14 Gold medals. Apart from the gold medals, the swimmers also set 12 new SEA Games records. The shooting and table tennis teams also came away with a handsome reward tonight, receiving $75,000 and $80,000 respectively for their outstanding performance in Vientiane, Laos.

7. At the event, appreciation plaques were given out to sponsors and supporters of Team Singapore to thank them for their unstinting support during the 25th SEA Games. They included Tote Board and Singapore Pools, NTUC Fairprice and Nestle Singapore Pte Ltd.

8. The contingent and guests were treated to a special photo exhibition presented by CANON, featuring the works of winners of the Canon SEA Games Photo Contest, jointly organised with The Straits Times. Photographers, Mr Wee Keng Hor and Mr Suhaimi Bin Abdullah, bagged the top prize of the competition and were in Vientiane, Laos, to capture key moments of Team Singapore competing at the Games. A selected collection of the photographs depicting highlights of the 25th SEA Games were on display at the MAP Awards tonight.
