This is the second major multi-sport event held in Singapore in conjunction with the nation’s golden jubilee celebrations this year and will be a fitting finale to the year-long festivities.  

Graced by Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean and Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, the community will be treated to an afternoon of fun and festivities at the Marina Bay Promenade in a bid to encourage everyone to embrace an event that is all about inclusiveness and courage to rise above life’s challenges.
