### **One Team Singapore For The 8th ASEAN Para Games**

**Singapore, 14 November 2015** – It is the final rally call for everyone to get behind our Team Singapore athletes and to celebrate the extraordinary at the region’s largest multi para sport event. This is the second major multi-sport event held in Singapore in conjunction with the nation’s golden jubilee celebrations this year and will be a fitting finale to the year-long festivities.

Graced by Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean and Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, the community will be treated to an afternoon of fun and festivities at the Marina Bay Promenade in a bid to encourage everyone to embrace an event that is all about inclusiveness and courage to rise above life’s challenges.

“Let us come together as one for Team Singapore in the forthcoming ASEAN Para Games. Through the Games, we hope that more Singaporeans of different abilities will realise their potential, participate in sport and lead active and healthy lives,” said Minister Fu. “Our athletes have been training very hard, and we need everyone to rally behind them. Your support will make a difference!”

Minister Fu is also the Chairperson of the 8th ASEAN Para Games Steering Committee.

**A shared identity with Team Singapore**

The fun-filled day will see the community enjoy a scenic Reindeer Walk-a-Wheelathon – a two-kilometre walk around the Marina Bay Promenade. As an annual event organised by the Singapore Disability Sports Council, participants will also be joined by Team Singapore athletes and officials as they traverse along the Bay.

Along the way, participants will be given an opportunity to witness the human formation of a red heart in a show of inclusiveness and support for disability sports as well as our Team Singapore athletes for the 8th ASEAN Para Games.

The highlight of the day’s proceedings will see everyone coming together to witness the ceremonial lighting of the ASEAN Para Games flame as well the official flag presentation to officially commemorate the Team Singapore athletes’ journey towards inspiring the nation at the 8th ASEAN Para Games.
