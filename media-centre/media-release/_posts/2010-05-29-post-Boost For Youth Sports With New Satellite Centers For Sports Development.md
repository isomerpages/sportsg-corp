### **Boost For Youth Sports With New Satellite Centers For Sports Development**

_Government Pumps in S$2.5m to Promote Youth Sports Development in Singapore as Part of Singapore 2010 Legacy_

**Singapore, 29 May 2010** - Youth sports in Singapore received a huge boost today when the Singapore Youth Sports Development (SYSD) committee unveiled its plans to have up to 26 Satellite Centres for Sports Development set up for selected sports that will be featured at the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games over the next two years. The introduction of the satellite centres is part of Singapore's legacy from hosting of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games to be held from 14 to 26 August 2010.

2. With S$2.5 million committed to the programme by the SYSD Committee, the satellite centres will be established in phases in existing sports facilities such as schools, sports and recreation centres as well as community centres that are located in the heartlands to allow for easy access. The first four centres for Sailing, Wrestling, Badminton and Basketball are set to be in operations by June 2010.

3. Chairmen of the SYSD committee, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and Ministry of Transport and Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Home Affairs officiated the launch ceremony of the Satellite Centres for Sports Development held at the Singapore Wrestling Federation today.

4. Targeted specially for children and youths aged six to 16, the Satellite Centres for Sports Development will serve as the launching pad for them to learn new sports in a safe, fun and friendly community setting. These satellite centres aim to provide these youths with multiple opportunities for participation in a diverse range of sports and at the same time, allow them to play regularly with their peers in a structured sports programme.

5. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for MCYS and MOT and Co-Chairman of the SYSD committee, Mr Teo Ser Luck said, "The Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games has catalysed a boost in youth sports development. The satellite centres will provide our youth more opportunities to learn and play sports in a fun, safe environment and encourage them to embrace a sporting lifestyle early in life. The centres will build on the momentum that we have developed in youth sports over the past two years and ensure continued growth of youth sports in Singapore beyond 2010."

6. Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Home Affairs and Co-Chairman of the SYSD Committee said, "While there are existing programmes that are in place to develop youth sports, the establishment of the Satellite Centres for Sports Development will make more sports accessible to our children and youths. The sports programme offered by the satellite centres will enable our youths to further advance their involvement in the sport, should they have the passion and flair for a certain sport. Their participation in the programme will also develop them holistically as it will not only equip them with sports skills, but also impart soft skills and values such as friendship, respect and sportsmanship."

7. The Satellite Centres for Sports Development programmes will be coordinated and managed by the respective National Sports Associations (NSA) of the Olympic sports. With the exception of sailing, each satellite centre will put participants through a 10 to 12-week beginner level programme to get them acquainted with the sport and pick up the basic skills needed to participate in the sport. For the sailing programme, participants will be offered a half-day introduction course to the sport.

8. Interested individuals will have to register through the respective NSAs to participate in the programme. Participants will be required to pay a nominal fee for each sport programme. The programmes will be delivered by qualified coaches identified by the NSAs. After completing the entry level programme offered by the satellite centres, participants can continue on to the intermediate and advance level programmes offered by the respective NSAs.
