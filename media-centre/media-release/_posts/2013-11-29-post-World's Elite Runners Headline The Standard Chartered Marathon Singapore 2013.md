**Singapore, 29 November 2013** - The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2013 will feature a selection of the world's top long distance runners, as they join 54,000 other participants to race in the nation's marquee running event on Sunday, 1 December.

2\.The international contingent will be headlined by Kenyan marathoner Sharon Cherop, the female winner of the 2012 Boston Marathon and runner up in the 2013 Berlin Marathon in which she clocked a remarkable personal best time of 2:22:28.

3\. The 29-year-old was joined at today's pre-race press conference by compatriot Beatrice Torotich and Bahrain's Aadam Ismaeel Khamis, as well as local hero and three-time winner of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (Singaporean Men's) Mok Ying Ren.

4\. Mok enters the 2013 event in fine form and will be looking to repeat his previous podium finishes as he prepares for the upcoming Southeast Asian Games Marathon event in Myanmar. The 25-year-old will undoubtedly be tested by the powerful men's international field, with the likes of Khamis possessing a personal best of 2:07:59.

5\. "The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore is a race I look forward to every year and 2013 is certainly no different. The event does a tremendous job of generating greater awareness around long distance running and it's been a big part of the sport's growth in Singapore. I hope the supporters come out in force to cheer the runners on Sunday," Mok said.

6\. Mr. Toh Boon Yi, Chief, Strategic Development and Marketing Group, Singapore Sports Council, commented: "We are very happy to have these world-class athletes racing in the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2013 and their participation is testament to our event's strong reputation on the international stage. It is also a fantastic opportunity for Singapore's top marathoners to test themselves against the world's best. We encourage everyone to come out and support our local heroes on Sunday, 1 December."

7\. As with previous years, the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore will feature three different start points; Marathon/Ekiden (Orchard), Half Marathon (Sentosa) and 10km/10km Wheelchair (Esplanade) before all routes lead to the finish point at the Padang.

8\. The Kids Dash (750m) will also start at the Esplanade, with over 4,000 young runners set to enjoy the unique thrill of racing alongside their friends and family in the fun category.

9\. The kids will also be able to enjoy a wide range of exciting activities and entertainment on the Padang, as once again the popular landmark will provide a carnival atmosphere for participants and supporters alike.

10\. The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2013 is again placing an emphasis on its supporters, with the complimentary 'Cheer Mobiles' available from the Padang transporting everyone to various vantage points along the route to cheer on the runners.

11\. Chris Robb, Managing Director, Spectrum Worldwide, commented on the overwhelming public response for this year's event: "The registration numbers are testament to the outstanding reputation the event has built over the years. Having been contracted as the event's official event organiser, it's vitally important that we not only continue the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore's great legacy but build on it for this year and the future editions to follow. We are confident that the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2013 will be another outstanding event and we look forward to seeing everyone on the start line this coming Sunday morning."
