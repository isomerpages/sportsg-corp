**Singapore, 29 November 2013** - The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2013 will feature a selection of the world's top long distance runners, as they join 54,000 other participants to race in the nation's marquee running event on Sunday, 1 December.

2.The international contingent will be headlined by Kenyan marathoner Sharon Cherop, the female winner of the 2012 Boston Marathon and runner up in the 2013 Berlin Marathon in which she clocked a remarkable personal best time of 2:22:28.

4. Mok enters the 2013 event in fine form and will be looking to repeat his previous podium finishes as he prepares for the upcoming Southeast Asian Games Marathon event in Myanmar. The 25-year-old will undoubtedly be tested by the powerful men's international field, with the likes of Khamis possessing a personal best of 2:07:59.

5. "The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore is a race I look forward to every year and 2013 is certainly no different. The event does a tremendous job of generating greater awareness around long distance running and it's been a big part of the sport's growth in Singapore. I hope the supporters come out in force to cheer the runners on Sunday," Mok said.
