### **Team Singapore To Head To Dehli 2010 As Scheduled**

**Singapore, 24 September 2010** - Team Singapore will be heading to the 19th Commonwealth Games Delhi 2010 as planned. The contingent will be made up of 68 athletes and 34 officials.

2. Said Team Singapore Chef-de-Mission to the 19th Commonwealth Games Delhi 2010 Annabel Pennefather, "We have been given the assurance by the organisers that the residential block where Team Singapore athletes and officials will be staying in will be spruced up and will be given the necessary cleaning it requires. We have informed them of our expectations and we have been assured that our expectations will be met."

3. An advance party of up to five personnel, led by assistant Chef-de-Mission Antony Lee will be heading up to New Delhi on 27 September 2010 to ensure that the living areas where Team Singapore athletes and officials will be residing will be ready in time for the contingent's arrival. The bulk of Team Singapore officials and contingents are expected to arrive in New Delhi on 29 and 30 September. Team Singapore athletes and officials will be occupying four floors in Block 26 at the Athletes Village.

4. Secretary-General of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC)/ Commonwealth Games Singapore (CGS) Chris Chan, who returned this morning from New Delhi, said that his meeting with officials of the organising committee and his visit to the Athletes and Games Village was useful as it provided him with a first-hand account of the situation on the ground. He was accompanied on his visit by officials from Singapore's mission in New Delhi.

5. He said, "We spoke to the organisers and were given a tour of the facilities while we were there. The organisers of the 19th Commonwealth Games Delhi 2010, including the Village Mayor Dalbir Singh, have given us the assurance that they are working round the clock to address all the issues which have been raised not just by us but some of the other contingents. With the advance party headed up to Delhi on Monday, we will be able to ensure that all our requests are met and that any outstanding issues will be sorted out by the organisers before the bulk of the contingent arrive in New Delhi for the games."

6. Team Singapore athletes and officials in New Delhi for the 19th Commonwealth Games will have a full-time medical team who will be supporting them throughout the Games. The medical team is led by Dr Cormac O'Muircheartaigh, Medical Director of the Singapore Sports Institute. He is supported by four medical staff. They will provide round-the-clock support and care for the Team Singapore contingent.

7. "Every member of the contingent has been screened medically and has received the necessary vaccinations required before they leave Singapore for New Delhi," said Dr. O'Muircheartaigh. We have also provided everyone with a 'Medical Care Pack', which includes vitamins to boost the immune system and to prevent illnesses and hand wash solutions for hygiene and health protection."
