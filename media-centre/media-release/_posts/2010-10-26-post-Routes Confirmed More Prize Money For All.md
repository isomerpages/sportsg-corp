### **Routes Confirmed, More Prize Money For All**

_SSC reveals route details for 60,000 runners as race date beckons_

**Singapore, 26 October 2010** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC), the organiser of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2010, rolled out a comprehensive incentive scheme to raise competition levels and the quality of runners at Asia's pinnacle running event on 5 December. The long-anticipated details of the three new routes were also announced, to provide all participants with as much time as possible to familiarise themselves with their respective routes with the event now less than six weeks away.

**Increase in prize money and incentives**

2. The SSC introduced a revised prize money structure of the prize fund for this year's race - an increase in prize money for the Elite and Open categories, a 'Champions Fund', for athletes who return to Singapore for the 2011 edition. Participants also have a chance of pocketing the 'Time Bonus', if they are able to meet certain times for the full marathon. Altogether the total prize purse now amounts to US$355,707 (S$473,090), making the SCMS 2010 one of the most lucrative races in the region.

3. Elite athletes this year can expect a higher level of competition, with a substantial US$15,000 (S$19,950) increase in prize money for the champions of both Men's and Women's categories. Runners in the Open and Veteran race categories also get a boost in their prize fund.

4. The 'Champions Fund' is a new incentive scheme for athletes returning to Singapore in 2011, with an additional US$5,000 (S$6,650) for each of the first placed athlete in both the Men's and Women's Full Marathon categories. To qualify, the first placed athlete must receive the Time Bonus, and return to race in 2011.

5. Commenting on the new incentive scheme and increase in prize money, David Voth, Chairman, SCMS 2010 Organising Committee and SSC's Senior Director, Sports Marketing Group, said, "To bring this race to the next level, the SSC spent considerable time and effort re-assessing the prize structure, and to find ways that will help further drive interest and participation for road running over the longer term. The improved prize model ensures a quality elite race component with elite world class athletes who are encouraged to aim for faster times and in turn an improved level of competition and also gives Singaporean and international runners an opportunity to look forward to a lucrative race at the end of the running calendar right here in Singapore. It is our ambition to make this race Asia's pinnacle race in time to come."

**Routes for three races revealed**

6. Details of the three race routes were announced, with changes made to accommodate the 60,000 participants and three unique start points - Orchard Road for the Full Marathon, Sentosa for the Half Marathon and Esplanade Bridge for the 10km category.

7. All routes have also been reinforced with additional medical support, with official medical provider Alexandra Health deploying 20 doctors, 110 nurses, 550 first aiders, 30 ambulances, 10 RAVs, 13 Kruzers, 21 bicycles and four buggies. There will also be six medical tents stationed across the three routes and at the finish line.

8. "Given the magnitude of this year?s race and three different routes, we have worked closely with the Singapore Sports Council, the organiser of the SCMS 2010, to implement every measure and precaution needed to ensure a safe running experience for all," said Dr Francis Lee, SCMS 2010 medical doctor from Alexandra Health.

**Full Marathon (42km)**

9. For the first time ever, the Full Marathon will kick-off at 5am, 30 minutes earlier than previous years, at the heart of Orchard Road at the T-junction after Ngee Ann City. Runners will run pass landmarks such as Fort Canning Park, Clarke Quay, Chinatown, the Esplanade, Singapore Flyer and the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort. The runners will cross the Helix Bridge before making the final push to the finish line at the Padang.

**Half Marathon (21km)**

10. Participants of the Half Marathon can also look forward to a colourful and spectacular run with runners set to be flagged off at the Sentosa Bridge.

11. The Half Marathon will see participants completing 1km out of the 21km route through Universal Studios Singapore. This will be the first time the theme park - which will be open before its normal operating hours to accommodate the SCMS 2010 - will host an event of this nature. This is also the first race in Asia which will have runners running through a theme park as part of a half marathon route. The park's guides and up to 21 well-known characters and mascots such as 'Shrek', 'Marilyn Monroe' and the animals from the animated movie 'Madagascar' will be out in full force to add to the festive mood, cheering the runners.

**10km**

12. The 10km run will start at the Esplanade Bridge. Runners will then head towards the Central Business District before turning back towards the Fullerton Hotel, and then on to the Esplanade Bridge. From there on they will continue their way past key landmarks on the Marina Bay before stopping the clock at the Padang.

13. Added David Voth, "With just about six weeks left to race day, we hope that runners are already preparing for the historic event. 2010 has been a great year for Singapore sports and we are looking forward to capping it off with another fantastic event which will put Singapore on the continental if not world map."

Note: The figures indicated above are based on the exchange rate of US$1 to S$1.33
