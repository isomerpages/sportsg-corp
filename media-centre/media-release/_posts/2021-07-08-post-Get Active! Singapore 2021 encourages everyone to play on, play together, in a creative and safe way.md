### **Get Active! Singapore 2021 encourages everyone to play on, play together, in a creative, fun and safe way**

GetActive! Singapore Workout collaborates with the NDP’s Dance of the Nation to rally Singaporeans from all over the world to join in the celebrations!

**Singapore, 7 July 2021** – With COVID-19 safe management measures in place, Singaporeans can continue to stay active and celebrate Singapore’s 56th National Day through sport. The GetActive! Singapore (GASG) 2021 campaign will offer activities in both virtual and physical settings for everyone to play and celebrate our nation’s birthday. Sport Singapore (SportSG) has organised an exciting line-up of sport festivals, competitions, and fun activities suitable for all ages and abilities. These events will run from 23 July to 8 August at the Singapore Sports Hub, selected ActiveSG sport centres and community spaces.

“In the past year, we have partnered the sport industry and others to create many opportunities in spite of COVID-19 to engage in sport and physical activity with friends and family. Whether it has been in virtual or small group settings, the desire to play reflects our unwavering SGUNITED spirit. Let us celebrate our Singapore Spirit and our nation’s birthday through sport in GetActive! Singapore 2021,” said Sport Singapore CEO Lim Teck Yin.

**GASG collaborates with NDP**

The GASG Workout remains a staple in every GASG campaign, to rally Singaporeans to keep active through dance fitness, no matter where they are. This year, the workout will be part of the National Day 2021’s Dance of the Nation initiative. In celebration of the nation’s 56th birthday, the National Day Parade (NDP) committee has called for dance-workout submissions from the public from 2 July 2021. The submission call will last for two weeks and selected submissions will be collated and shared across NDP’s social channels, for the community to ‘participate’ virtually and be part of this year NDP celebrations.

The GASG workout video will serve as reference for the public to gain inspiration and create simple yet engaging dance moves with their families, friends and even the larger community to follow. The theme, “Together, Our Singapore Spirit”, calls on Singaporeans to reinvigorate the Singapore Spirit and spur ourselves on, to overcome setbacks and build a stronger Singapore. Although celebrations will take place in a decentralised manner across the country, Singapore can still ‘come together’ and celebrate the nation’s birthday meaningfully, from wherever they are.

**Start With 60 (SW60), #SW60**

A national online movement aimed at challenging Singaporeans to kickstart an active lifestyle journey through 60 seconds of physical activity. Participants may draw inspiration from the GASG website resource library which hosts various exercises and sport challenges. The exercises were curated by SportSG’s Active Health Coaches to encourage people to stay active with simple movements that are easily incorporated into one’s daily schedule. The sport challenges designed by Coaches from the ActiveSG Academies and Clubs, will provide an element of competition and fun to encourage participants to test their fitness levels and play with a “pass it on” spirit. Participants will perform 60 seconds of physical activity or take on an online challenge, post it, and tag three other friends to continue the movement and do better. SW60 will also take place physically at various GASG events around the island with booths for event participants to try out different SW60 workouts. Facilitators will also be present on site to share the health benefits of the different exercises.

**More exciting GASG Activities**

GASG will feature a variety of activities under Seniors’ Sports Day, Active Groove, YouthCreates and the Nurture Kids festival to cater for seniors, youths and children respectively. These initiatives will be conducted physically and virtually with engaging, interactive elements across both formats.  

In addition, public can also participate in GASG through GameOn Nila, the in-app game within the ActiveSG app. During GASG, participants can win prizes by completing tasks at selected nature discovery trails in Singapore including hiking at MacRitchie and East Coast parks, kayaking and cycling around the island, just to name a few. Participants will also be able to scan QR codes when they complete activities at GASG Sport Festival sites to earn points to redeem up to $5000 worth of prizes.
