### **SSC & Mindchamps Ink Memorandum Of Understanding For Special Programmes To Enchance Youth Athlete's Holistic Development**

_New Programme Specially Developed for Youth Athletes In Training for Singapore 2010_

**Singapore, 26 January 2010** - Youth athletes can now tap into the MindChamps Youth Athlete 3-Mind Academic Programme to assist them in balancing the demands of sports and studies. The customised programme, specially developed by MindChamps Singapore Pte Limited, will be made available to athletes who are currently in training for the upcoming Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games.

2. MindChamps' commitment in delivering this programme to the youth athletes was marked with an official signing ceremony of a Memorandum of Understanding together with the Singapore Sports Council that was held this afternoon.

3. The programme will equip youth athletes with tips on studying more effectively to allow them to devote more time to their sport preparation for Singapore 2010 which will be held from 14 to 26 August this year. A complement to the SSC's Programme for Athletes' Career and Education, which provides athletes with education counseling, job preparation and personal development courses, this programme will promote the holistic development of athletes so that they will become well-rounded and skilled individuals with successful careers in sports and beyond.

4. "We have always encouraged and supported our athletes to pursue both their sports and educational aspirations, through our comprehensive sport performance and career education programmes. The MindChamps Youth Athlete 3-Mind Academic Programme adds value to our existing programmes with a tailor-made solution to assist young athletes with their academic studies. We are pleased to have MindChamps on board with us to educate our youth athletes training for the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games on how to be more effective in managing the demands of their studies," said Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer of Singapore Sports Council.

5. The MindChamps Youth Athlete 3-Mind Academic Programme is a voluntary supplementary course and will be made available to 100 youth athletes from the 26 Youth Olympic Games' sports from 1 February 2010 onwards. The complimentary programme, which covers three core modules titled Learning Mind, Champion Mind and Creative Mind, will be conducted by MindChamps.

6. Commenting on the collaboration, Mr David Chiem, Founder and Group CEO of MindChamps said: "In sports and the academic arenas, one of the most critical success factors is our mindset. MindChamps is proud to be able to train our youth athletes to give them the Champion Mindset and at the same time equip them with cutting-edge learning techniques to achieve academic excellence. Armed with MindChamps' proven and scientifically sound techniques, our athletes will be able to strongly focus on their sports training."
