### **Sports Medicine And Sports Science Gets Boost From Collaboration Between SSC And CGH**

The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today with Changi General Hospital (CGH) in a collaborative effort to develop world-class Sports Medicine and Sports Science (SMSS) capabilities in Singapore for high-performance athletes.

This collaboration will open new frontiers for Singapore SMSS capabilities and move it to higher levels of excellence.

Allowing for the integration of resources, one of the aims of this collaboration is to bring about an enhanced SMSS delivery system with the establishment of a service-delivery and professional network.

"To groom and support world-class athletes, we need support systems such as SMSS to be of the highest level of excellence on a sustainable basis. This is imperative in order for us to be able to gain increasing recognition in the international sporting community. Such strategic collaborations will enable us to put together SMSS resources to attain both operational and service excellence in all ways. SMSS professionals in Singapore will also benefit from such initiatives," said Mr. Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), SSC.

With higher expectations of athletes' performance at international sporting events, it is essential that SMSS support provided should be further intensified to ensure that these athletes will benefit immensely as they pursue sporting excellence for the glory of the nation. They will not only enjoy access to more specialists and facilities, but also from key developments in future SMSS research.

The collaboration between SSC and CGH provides synergy where both organisations are able to leverage upon each other strengths in the SMSS field.

While SSC through its Sports Medicine Research Centre (SMRC) offers multiple years of experience working with high-performance athletes and is armed with in-depth knowledge of each of these athletes and their requirements, CGH through its Changi Sports Medicine Centre provides multi-disciplinary sports medicine service to athletes and active individuals. Both the centres have a well-entrenched educational and teaching programme for members of the sports fraternity and healthcare professionals respectively and have been active in research.

CGH's CEO, Mr T K Udairam said, "SSC and CGH share the same vision for sports medicine in Singapore and we will continue to work together to meet the athletes' needs. By coming together with SMRC, we can concentrate our resources in research, clinical care and teaching so as to achieve the vision for Singapore to be a centre of sporting excellence."
