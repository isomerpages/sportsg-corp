### **17,000 Hearts, One Team Singapore For The SEA Games**
_Team Nila Strengthens and Unites Communities Through Sport_

**Singapore, 24 February 2015** – Volunteers of different ages and backgrounds were treated to a night of fun at the Waterworld at Universal Studios Singapore in appreciation of their contribution to make a difference to the lives of others. Organised by Sport Singapore (SportSG), the event aims to recognise the efforts of sports volunteers and further cultivate the spirit of volunteerism in Singapore.

In his address, Guest of Honour and Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Mr Lawrence Wong paid tribute to the volunteers’ contribution and service to Singapore’s sporting landscape. “I’m very encouraged by the overwhelming response of Singaporeans across all walks of life to volunteer at the SEA Games. Volunteers are crucial to the success of every sporting event. I’ve seen that in all the major Games I’ve been too. Volunteers give their time and expertise to a range of critical tasks, often carried out behind the scenes, so that athletes can focus on their events, and spectators can have a good experience. I hope this spirit of sports volunteerism will energise and inspire more Singaporeans to step forward and volunteer in other areas too.” 

##### **A common identity: Team Nila**

Volunteers also witnessed the launch of ‘Team Nila’, the new sports volunteer brand. The brand serves to not only continue the legacy of ‘the Purple Army’ by creating a common identity for sports volunteers, but also forge a sense of belonging and instil a sense of pride among all sports volunteers.

Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, Sport Singapore, explained that the Team Nila brand exemplifies the passion and team work that all volunteers bring to the table. “Vision 2030 calls for the development of a national effort to strengthen communities by encouraging volunteerism through sport. Singaporeans from all walks of life have responded to that call and are stepping up to be part of Team Nila. We are thus equally committed to work hard to ensure positive volunteer experiences by co-creating opportunities for learning and growth, and evolving appropriate forms of recognition for their outstanding efforts.”

##### **More than 17,000 volunteers came forward for the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games**

Stepping forward to the call for volunteers, over 17,000 Singaporeans and residents have signed up to be a part of the 28th Southeast Asian Games. Covering multiple roles during the games, more than half of the volunteers have already started preparations by attending the relevant training sessions.

Volunteers contribute their expertise and experience in diverse areas.

Take 42-year old Ms Lee Seow Ser who will be volunteering her services as a Digital Content Producer for the upcoming SEA Games. Having just completed her treatment for breast cancer which she discovered last year, Ms Lee is also a mother of two young children aged eight and 10.

Now on a year-long sabbatical, Ms Lee previously volunteered in the 2010 Youth Olympic Games and is also an active contributor and creator of content on family life and parenting.

She adds, “I have always looked back with fond memories on my experience, having volunteered at the 2010 Youth Olympic Games in Singapore. Having completed my radiation therapy, I signed up to volunteer as a digital content producer for the 28th SEA Games as this will be a great opportunity for me to share and hone my skills while giving back to my country.”

Another pair of volunteers is eight-year-old Charlotte Ng and her father, Mr Ng Chee Wei. Charlotte is currently the youngest SEA Games volunteer and both father and daughter will be working hand-in-hand as sports specialist volunteers for equestrian.

Says Mr Ng, “Charlotte has always had a passion and a special interest in horse-riding. When we heard the call for equestrian sport specialist volunteers, I took this opportunity to sign up with her so that we can not only bond as a family, but also accompany her on this learning journey. I hope that through her experience, Charlotte will be inspired to continue giving back where she can and embrace the spirit of sports volunteerism.”

Other roles that the volunteers will be involved in include providing corporate support services, medical services, workforce management, media relations, sports and venue operations, games services, community engagement, information technology and logistics.  
  
##### **Corporate Singapore embraces sports volunteerism**

In addition to members of the community, Corporate Singapore has also stepped forward, in a show of support to the cause of sports volunteerism. In combination they contribute to more than 65 percent of the total number of volunteers.

Organisations that have stepped forward to support the SEA Games by encouraging their employees or students to volunteer include Institute of Technical Education, Republic Polytechnic Temasek Polytechnic, various other Institutes of Higher Learning, Heartware Network, Deloitte, Singapore Institution of Safety Officers and more.

Mr Lim who is also the Chairman of the Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) added, “Seeing the generosity and goodwill of our volunteers and Corporate Singapore who have come forward to participate as Singapore hosts its first SEA Games in 22 years has been very heartening. It shows that Singaporeans understand the significance of our nation’s 50th anniversary and the importance of being great hosts. I am confident that our volunteers as Singapore’s ambassadors will provide an extraordinary experience to the athletes, officials and guests. They are also raring to go create an extraordinary celebration for our people.”
