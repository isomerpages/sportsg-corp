### **Sports Enthusiasts race alongside SEA Games athletes**

This 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games has pledged to bring out the extraordinary, and towards this, SINGOSC is pleased to announce three community events open to members of the public. Non-competitive in nature, sport enthusiasts are offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the SEA Games from the athlete’s perspective and take part in Nila Swim & Aquathlon, and Nila Run.

The Nila Swim & Aquathlon and Nila Run will take place on Saturday, 6 June and Sunday, 7 June 2015 respectively.

Mr Toh Boon Yi, Chief of Community & Corporate Outreach, SINGSOC said, “The SEA Games is the largest sports festival to take place in Singapore for a while and we want to find an opportunity for everyone to get into the thick of the action. The Nila Run, Swim and Aquathlon allow the amateur sports enthusiasts to run and swim alongside the SEA Games athletes. It will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for all participants. We therefore invite all running and swimming enthusiasts to not only participate in the Nila Swim & Aquathlon and Nila Run but also come together to support and cheer on the athletes as they give it their all to do their nation proud.”

For the first time in SEA Games history, members of the public who sign up for the Nila Swim & Aquathlon will be swimming and running a modified route of the SEA Games Triathlon Course. The flag-off for the mass swim and run will take place once the SEA Games athletes have cleared designated points, to ensure that, both, the community and elite participants have an enjoyable and safe experience. Careful planning and consideration in the route have also been catered for, as to ensure that the SEA Games competition will run smoothly, and in accordance with the rules and regulations.

Similarly, for the Nila Run, the 10km run will flag-off after the SEA Games Marathon athletes. Participants are expected to finish the 10km non-competitive run within three hours, and as safe guards to ensure that there will be no clash in paths, there will be stipulated cut-off times made known along the route. For example, Nila Run participants are expected to cross the 4km mark before 7.30am. This is approximately, 1 hour and 20 minutes after the community run flag-off. Participants who are unable to pass the 4km mark by then, will be diverted to facilitate the Marathon runners of the 28th SEA Games.

“Competing on home soil and representing one's country is an honour for any athlete. With the Nila Run happening in conjunction with the SEA Games, and with the run ending near the finish line of the SEA Games Marathon, I hope that the participants will come and support us athletes as we run to the finish line. The support from the community means a lot to us, and can make the difference between victory and defeat. We hope that Singaporeans will come out in strength to support Team Singapore at the 28th SEA Games,” said Soh Rui Yong, Team Singapore athlete who will be competing in the Marathon event.

SEA Games organisers also hope that after watching the SEA Games athletes complete the Marathon, members of the public will be encouraged to spend the rest of their weekend at the surrounding competition venues, including the Sports Hub. Visitors to the Sports Hub during the 28th SEA Games can expect a carnival of activities in addition to the 10 sports happening at the National Stadium, OCBC Aquatic Centre, OCBC Arena and Singapore Indoor Stadium.
