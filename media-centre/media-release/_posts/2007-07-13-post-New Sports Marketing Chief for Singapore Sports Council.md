### **New Sports Marketing Chief for Singapore Sports Council**

The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) today announced that Mr Kelven Tan has joined as Chief, Sports Marketing. His appointment took effect 9 July 2007.

As Chief, Sports Marketing, Kelven, 45, will oversee SSC's high participation and industry development groups including sports business and international and mega events. He will also provide leadership guidance across SSC and the sports industry as a member of its senior management.

He is well equipped to manage SSC's Sports Marketing division and brings with him a wealth of experience in strategic marketing, events creation and new business development for sports, leisure and entertainment. He is also actively involved in numerous industry task forces and advisory work.

Says Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO, SSC, "Kelven has a crucial role to play and we are delighted to welcome him to SSC. With the development of the Singapore Sports Hub, it is imperative that SSC ramps up the development of a sports culture in Singapore and increase participation by Singaporeans. The attraction of key international players and organisations towards Sporting Singapore over the next few years will also help to elevate the profile of sports further in a rapidly growing industry."

Prior to joining SSC, Kelven led the operations planning of Singapore Flyer as General Manager. Before that, he was Product Management Director for Sentosa Leisure Group, spearheading the evolution of a world-class organisation for best-in-class practices and services. In Sentosa, he led his team towards winning many international awards such as the Grand Pinnacle for Sentosa Flowers and Best New Creative Event (Gold) for Balloon Hat Festival, both awarded by the International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA).

Kelven also had a pivotal role as Assistant General Manager at Kerry Leisure Concept, Southeast Asia, where he positioned the organisation to deliver a fully integrated family entertainment and retail shopping experience for its various projects in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. He has also served on the National Day Parade's Creative Advisory Panels and been awarded the International Association of Amusement Parks & Attractions Meritorious Service Award for contribution to the growth of international relations among its members in Southeast Asia.

Says Kelven, "I am pleased to join SSC and look forward to this new challenge of leading the Sports Marketing team. Sports participation and industry development in this region is poised for greater growth leading to many exciting sports business platforms. That in turn will strengthen the foundations we have built, as we lead the charge in making Singapore a true Sports Hub."

Kelven graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts from the National University of Singapore, majoring in English Language and Sociology. He is currently the only Asian who is a Certified Festivals and Events Executive (CFEE) awarded by the IFEA based in Boise, Idaho. He is married and has 2 children.
