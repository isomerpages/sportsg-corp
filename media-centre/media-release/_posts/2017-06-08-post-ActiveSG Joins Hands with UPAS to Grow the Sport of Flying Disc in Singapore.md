### **ActiveSG Joins Hands with UPAS to Grow the Sport of Flying Disc in Singapore**

The sport of Flying Disc will now be part of ActiveSG’s stable of academies and clubs where people of all ages and abilities will be given opportunities and access to play and enjoy the emerging sport. In collaboration with the Ultimate Players Association (Singapore), a local non-profit organization governing all Flying Disc related activities in Singapore, the ActiveSG Flying Disc Club was launched at the UPA(S) Mixed Nationals, which saw over 500 players from 20 teams competing in the annual event.

Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Ms Grace Fu, who participated in a Flying Disc “Fly-Pass” alongside 20 of the top Flying Disc players in the country, said “Flying Disc sports, such as Ultimate, are easy to pick up, exciting to play and watch, and very popular among the youths. The new ActiveSG Flying Disc Club will grow these sports further, particularly for people who wish to continue after school. I hope this will encourage more people to get active even after leaving school!”

There are currently more than 50 competitive Flying Disc teams in Singapore, made up of private clubs registered with UPA(S) as well as the school teams from various Junior Colleges, Polytechnics, ITEs and Universities in Singapore. There are more than 4,000 active Flying Disc players in Singapore, where majority of the players are made up of teenagers and young adults aged 17 to 28.

Targeting youths below the age of 17 as well as older working adults and seniors, who do not have similar opportunities to play the sport, the new club will expose the sport to these age groups where they can enjoy the sport at a recreational level.

Ms Ang Zi Wei, President of the UPA(S) said, “Flying Disc sports are attractive to youth as they are easy to pick up! They have a strong emphasis on the Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every player. This inculcates sportsmanship and leadership qualities within youth at an accelerated pace.   Through the ActiveSG Flying Disc Club, there will be more opportunities for youth to learn, play and develop their interest in the sport.”

“While the sport has a large youth following, Flying Disc sports also engage older adults as it provides a convenient avenue for corporates to keep fit and socialise outside of work hours. This is why the planned social play sessions organised by the ActiveSG Flying Disc Club will be ideal for those who want to pick up the sport in a less competitive environment,” Ms Ang added.

To start off, the ActiveSG Flying Disc Club will be organising regular social play sessions on weekday evenings at ActiveSG stadiums in Queenstown, Woodlands and Clementi. Members of public who want to find friends to play Flying Disc with or are interested to learn how to play the game can do so at these sessions. Subsequently, these sessions will be opened up to more locations, including the many Free-to-Play school facilities that are open to public under the Dual-Use-Scheme.

Keeping to its intent of providing opportunities and access to Singaporeans to play and live better through sport, Mr Lai Chin Kwang, Chief of ActiveSG said, “Flying Disc is one of the sports that has no or less barriers to learn and play. It can be played at open spaces by anyone regardless of age or fitness level. It brings families and friends together to have fun and allows people to make friends. Most importantly, ActiveSG Flying Disc Club gives another opportunity for Singaporeans to play and stay active.”
