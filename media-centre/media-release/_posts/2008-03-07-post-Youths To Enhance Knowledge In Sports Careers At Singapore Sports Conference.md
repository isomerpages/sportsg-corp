### **Youths To Enhance Knowledge In Sports Careers At Singapore Sports Conference**

Some 600 youths from various tertiary institutions in Singapore will get the opportunity to learn more about establishing a career in sports at the Singapore Sports Conference, jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and Republic Polytechnic (RP). The event, themed "Youth &amp; Sports: Charting the Road Ahead" will be held for the second time running on 8 and 9 March 2008 at the Republic Polytechnic.

Formerly known as the Young Sports Leaders Seminar (YSLS), the Singapore Sports Conference aims to enhance tertiary students' knowledge in various areas of sports such as sports marketing and event management so as to excite them on the myriad of job opportunities available in the sports industry today.

"The sports scene in Singapore has never been more vibrant and dynamic than what we have today, and this presents tremendous opportunities for those who want to carve a career in sports. The Singapore Sports Conference will not only engage youths who already have their sights on establishing a career in sports, but also reach out to others by highlighting the various exciting career paths that are available in the industry. A sports career can be rewarding and exciting. I urge all youths to embrace the opportunity to participate in this event and learn more about careers in sports," said Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer, SSC.

**What's on**<br>

The conference will feature two overseas speakers, Professor Robert M. Malina from the United States of America and Mr Teemu Japisson from Finland. Professor Malina will speak on global trends and issues in youth sports while Mr Japisson will speak on how children's sports can be developed (For more details on the keynote addresses, please refer to Annex B).

In addition, the young participants can look forward to a series of workshops covering four areas of sports - Sports Management, Sports Science, Sports Pedagogy, and Outdoor and Adventure Sports (For more details on the workshops, please refer to Annex C). Conducted by familiar faces in the sports fraternity, these workshops will expose youths to the different sports areas and give them a greater insight into possible careers in the sports industry.

On the first day of the conference, participants can also look forward to dialogue sessions facilitated by prominent sports practitioners and former national athletes. Youths will have an opportunity to engage them and hear them share their experience and knowledge of the sports industry today. Besides former national athletes, the recently crowned Singapore Sports Idols, Team Singapore Volunteers and young Team Singapore Ambassadors will also share their experience on their sports journeys. (For more details on the dialogue sessions, please refer to Annex D.)

For those who want practical experience, the conference will also engage the participants by providing 14 sessions ranging from triathlon basics, endurance running, agility training and other sports. A strength and conditioning coach from the Sports Medicine and Sports Science Division of SSC, will also be available to teach participants how to enhance their strength (For more details on the practical sessions, please refer to Annex E).

Professor Low Teck Seng, Principal and CEO, Republic Polytechnic said, "We are happy to work together with SSC to raise awareness about career prospects open to young people who want to establish themselves in the sports and health industries. This is a win-win for our partners and us because our students will not only gain in knowledge about future career options; they will also contribute to the success of the event by offering fresh ideas to market and manage the event well. We have no doubt everyone will emerge from this conference better informed and excited about the future of sports in Singapore."
