**Singapore, 2 July 2011** - History has been made again for the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) 2011, as registration hit the halfway mark with 35,000 runners signed up as of 3pm today - a mere nine days since registration opened on 23 June at 11am. This meant that the Marathon saw an average of three sign-ups every minute over this period.

2. This surpasses 2010's record of 15 days for 35,000 runners. The record-breaking number is an affirmation of the success and popularity of the People's Race, when 70,000 runners are expected to take to the streets on 4 December 2011.

3. Numbers were equally impressive during the registration launch of the SCMS 2011, with 7,800 runners registered by 7pm, compared to 6,543 runners during the same period last year. Just three hours into the launch, registration for the Ekiden race category, the second edition since its introduction in 2010, ended with all 100 teams registered for by 2pm.

4. As of 3pm today, the 10km leads the pack with almost 60% of slots taken up, followed closely by the Kids Dash at close to 55%. Registration for the Full Marathon and Half Marathon are each about 50% filled up, while the slots for the 5km Fun Run has reached the 25% mark. The present registration data for the SCMS 2011 also shows that the highest number of registrations come from the 21 to 30 age group.

5. Organiser for the SCMS, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), reflects on the quick take up rate of SCMS. David Voth, Senior Director, Sports Business, SSC and Vice-Chairman of the SCMS 2011 Organising Committee said, "We are constantly surprised and impressed with how the running community in Singapore embrace the SCMS. The pace at which this year's slots are being filled up is impressive and really underscores the SCMS as Singapore's marquee running event."

6. Online registration for the SCMS 2011 is ongoing with the Early Bird period ending on 20 July. Walk-in registration is also available at selected SSC Sports & Recreation Centres (SRCs).

**'Run for good' introduces new platform**

7. Along with creating an event that involves the community on a whole, the SSC is looking to translate the growing involvement to having participants taking part in the race with an additional purpose. Charity has always been part of the event, but to encourage more runners to be involved with its 'Run for good' programme, the SSC has introduced a brand new concept hosted on the online platform GIVE.sg, the Official Charity Fundraising Platform for 2011.

8. With GIVE.sg, runners can now nominate a charity of their choice and create a page on [www.give.asia](www.give.asia) to rally for funds. Alternatively they can raise funds for any of the 35 nominated beneficiaries[1]. Besides providing runners with the flexibility of choice, this platform also allows anyone in the world to donate using their credit or debit card in a safe and secure way. Local donors are entitled to a tax deduction of 2.5 times the donation amount when they donate to any organisations with Institution of Public Character (IPC) status. Runners can join the 'Run for good' charity programme at [www.singaporemarathon.com](https://singaporemarathon.com/).
