### **Team Singapore is RED-Y to Roar**
With exactly two weeks to go to the official Opening Ceremony of the 28th SEA Games, it is only fitting that Singapore gets RED-Y to roar.

Giordano’s I AM RED merchandise returns its second edition as part of the Team Singapore x Giordano collection. The collaboration between Team Singapore and Giordano encourages Singaporeans to wear their support for Singapore’s sport stars.

As Singapore hosts both the SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games this year, there is no better way to lend support to Team Singapore than to don the national colours while cheering the athletes on in unity. From Monday, 25 May 2015, fans and supporters will be able to get Team Singapore merchandise from 22 participating Giordano stores island-wide.

The limited edition Team Singapore x Giordano collection of merchandise includes Singapore jerseys, polo tees, cotton tees, umbrellas, scarves and caps. Priced from $19, the apparel range is available for adults and children. Accessories are priced upwards from S$13. 30,000 pieces of merchandise have been specially manufactured for the collection.

Five athletes showcased the collection earlier today – Olympic gymnast Lim Heem Wei, sprinter UK Shyam, Wushu exponent Tao Yi Jun, water polo player Lim Yao Xiang and Paralympic swimmer Theresa Goh. These athletes know personally the importance of home ground support and how much it means to see and hear supporters in the stands as they compete.

“Seeing a venue filled with people wearing red and hearing the crowd roar will touch the athletes immensely” said water polo player Lim Yao Xiang. His sentiments were echoed by Paralympic swimmer Theresa Goh, who said, “I will definitely be wearing red when supporting my fellow swimmers at the upcoming Games as a sign of solidarity. We are One Team Singapore.”

Mr Toh Boon Yi, Chief, Strategic Development and Marketing Group, Sport Singapore said, “I am heartened to see companies such as Giordano step forward to show their support for Team Singapore. Specifically through Giordano’s involvement, we hope to see Singaporeans fill all competition venues with a sea of red. Together, we are ready to cheer as One Team Singapore.”

“We are excited and honoured to be a part of the Games in supporting all Team Singapore athletes once again as they gun for glory. We hope to see Singaporeans of all walks of life turning up in the merchandise, RED-Y to show their support. With Singapore hosting the Games this round, there is no better time to wear RED.” said Mr Patrick Yeo, Director of South East Asia Operations, Giordano.

**Giordano supports SportCares**

Giordano will be donating two percent of all net proceeds from the sale of merchandise from this collection to the SportCares Foundation. This foundation, rolled out in line with Vision 2030: Live Better through Sports, seeks to use sport as a vehicle for social good by linking beneficiaries, volunteers and philanthropic partners through sports programmes to touch lives. One such SportCares initiative includes organising sports clinics for youth-at-risk.
