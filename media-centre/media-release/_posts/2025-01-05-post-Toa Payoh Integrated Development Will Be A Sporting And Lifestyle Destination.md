<p>Singapore, 5 January 2025 – Sport Singapore (SportSG), alongside co-located
partners Ministry of Health (MOH), National Healthcare Group Polyclinics
(NHG Polyclinics), National Library Board (NLB) and National Parks Board
(NParks) held a groundbreaking ceremony today to mark the start of construction
for the Toa Payoh Integrated Development. The development is part of the
Sports Facilities Master Plan – a key recommendation under Singapore’s
Vision 2030 sport blueprint.</p>
<p>Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth &amp; Second
Minister for Law; Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Transport, Second Minister
for Finance and Adviser for Bishan-Toa Payoh Grassroots Organisations;
Ms Gan Siow Huang, Minister of State for Education and Manpower and Adviser
for Marymount Grassroots Organisations; as well as Mr Chong Kee Hiong and
Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Advisers for Bishan-Toa Payoh Grassroots Organisations
officiated the ceremony. The event was attended by Team Singapore athletes
and the sport fraternity, community partners, as well as members of the
public.</p>
<p>Expected to be completed by 2030, the integrated development will house
sport facilities alongside other community amenities like a town park,
library and a polyclinic. The plans include a 10,000-seater stadium, indoor
and outdoor swimming pools, an Indoor Sports Hall featuring 22 badminton
courts, and multiple sheltered futsal and tennis courts. These facilities
will cater to the diverse needs and interests of residents across all age
groups and bring vibrancy to the neighbourhood. The sports facilities will
also be designed to support the hosting of community and sporting events,
as well as training for some national athletes. Attendees were offered
a preview of the integrated development via a refreshed 3D model, artist’s
impressions, and a fly through video. The public also enjoyed fringe activities
such as sport try-outs, games, health screenings, library sign-ups, and
scent bag making using fragrant plants. These experiences align with the
integrated development’s focus on health, community engagement, and active
living.</p>
<p>For the planned list of sport facilities, please refer to Annex A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr Alan Goh, Chief Executive Officer, SportSG said, “The Toa Payoh Integrated
Development is more than just new facilities – it represents our commitment
to create sporting experiences for Singaporeans to unite and improve their
lives. This vibrant space will bring top-class sporting infrastructure
and events closer to our community, to benefit not just our community residents
but our national athletes as well. This is part of our ongoing efforts
to develop innovative, inclusive, and citizen-centric spaces that can help
to inspire Singaporeans to Live Better Through Sport. This rejuvenated
development will cater to the evolving sporting needs, interests, and aspirations
of our people, and we envision it to become an exciting sporting and lifestyle
destination at the heart of Toa Payoh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The redeveloped NHG Toa Payoh Polyclinic is part of the Ministry of Health’s
plan to continue to invest in primary care, and to enable Singaporeans
to receive care closer to home. NHG Toa Payoh Polyclinic caters to patients
of all ages from children to the elderly in the multi-generational estate,
providing childhood developmental screening, chronic disease management,
and health promotion interventions to encourage healthy living and active
ageing. The redeveloped Polyclinic, which will replace the existing one,
highlights NHG Polyclinics’ close partnerships with the co-located agencies,
working together to strengthen preventive care, empower patients and residents
to achieve their health goals, and improve health and well-being.</p>
<p>The new library, which will replace the existing one, will boast larger
spaces and new services to meet the evolving needs of patrons and provide
an enhanced visitor experience. This is in line with NLB’s LAB25 (Libraries
and Archives Blueprint 2025) to work with partners to reimagine and transform
its libraries and archives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NLB’s Chief Executive Officer Mr Ng Cher Pong said: “We are excited to
be part of this upcoming integrated hub, and to work with partners and
the community to develop a bigger library in Toa Payoh. In being co-located
within the hub, our patrons in the central region can look forward to even
greater ease of access to the library’s programmes, reading and learning
resources.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toa Payoh Town Park will be rejuvenated as part of the overall Toa Payoh
Integrated Development with enhanced greenery and new amenities. At the
same time, its landscaping will be designed around the existing terrain,
and heritage features such as the iconic Lookout Tower will be retained.
From the earlier public consultation, NParks is looking into providing
new features like an allotment garden, a therapeutic garden, multi-purpose
event lawn and spaces, a dog run, and a nature playgarden for children
to connect with nature through play in a natural habitat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Hwang Yu-Ning, Chief Executive Officer, NParks said, “The transformed
park will offer a green respite for visitors of all ages and interests
and bring the benefits of nature closer to the community. We also welcome
residents to join the Nature Kakis Network, which has a Chapter at Toa
Payoh Central, to spearhead and organise City in Nature related initiatives
such as therapeutic horticulture activities. Through the Nature Kakis,
we hope more people will get to appreciate the greenery in our park and
eventually become stewards of our natural heritage.”</p>
