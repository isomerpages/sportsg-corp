Team Singapore athletes, dignitaries from the SEA Games Federation & ASEAN Para Sports Federation, sport volunteers, and members of the public were treated to an evening of sports and musical extravaganza to mark the beginning of the 28th SEA Games and 8th ASEAN Para Games journey.

2\. President Tony Tan Keng Yam and Chairman of the Singapore Southeast Asian Games (SINGSOC) Steering Committee, Mr Lawrence Wong, unveiled the official logos for both Games through a special launch mechanism by Team Singapore athletes at 8:15pm, or 2015 hrs. The Games tagline “Celebrate the Extraordinary” was also introduced. It encapsulates the celebration of the human spirit and the call for everyone to share their own experience in overcoming challenges.

6\. Nila, a familiar face to the Singapore sporting scene was also introduced as the mascot for the 28th SEA Games & 8th ASEAN Para Games. Nila was first introduced as the Singapore National Games mascot in 2012, and subsequently expanded his role into the mascot for Sporting Singapore. Nila is back, trimmer and fitter, and equipped with a brand new wardrobe. He is all set to ignite the passion of fans at the Games!

7\. Original compositions from local artistes under the guidance of Music Director, Dr Sydney Tan to the theme of the Games, were also performed at the event:

* You’re Almost There – written by Joel Tan (Gentle Bones) and Ruth Ling, performed by Joel Tan; 
* Greatest – written and performed by Daphne Khoo
* Forever – written by Joshua Wan and performed by The Steve McQueens
* Still – written and performed by Charlie Lim
* Colours – written and performed by Jean Tan
* Ordinary – written by Amir Masoh and performed by John Molina
* Unbreakable – written by Amir Masoh, performed by Tabitha Nauser

8\. Other acts included Kelvin Tan, also known as Chen Wei Lian who performed “Treasure Every Moment”, a song composed by Dick Lee. The adrenaline-pumping night continued with a party to the tunes spun by DJ Aldrin – one of Singapore’s most renowned disc jockeys.

9\. Over the next few months, more songs with accompanying music videos will be introduced in the lead-up to 2015.

10\. Mr Lawrence Wong, Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, who also chairs the Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) Steering Committee, said, “Today, we celebrate Team Singapore’s achievements and also launch our campaign to 2015, which is also the year of our Golden Jubilee. Next year, we will see the return of the SEA Games and the debut of the ASEAN Para Games in Singapore – both held in our brand new National Stadium and Sports Hub. Our athletes will compete with the best in the region, and will strive to improve on their performances in Myanmar. Many have told me that they are making a special effort for the Games, because they are competing here at home, in front of our home crowd.

11\. "More than just about sporting events, the Games are also about the hopes and dreams of individuals and communities. They are about the human spirit and our shared aspirations. The Games will bring together ordinary people with extraordinary dreams. So the theme we have chosen for the Games is to ‘Celebrate the Extraordinary’. Join us a participant, volunteer or spectator, and be part of this historic event. Remember, together we are stronger. Together, let us together celebrate the extraordinary, let’s show our Singapore spirit, and let’s make 2015 a truly extraordinary year for Singapore."

12\. The 28th SEA Games will be held from 5-16 June 2015, and the 8th ASEAN Para Games are to be held in December in the same year.
