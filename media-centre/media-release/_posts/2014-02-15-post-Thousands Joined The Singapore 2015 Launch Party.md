10. Mr Lawrence Wong, Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, who also chairs the Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) Steering Committee, said, “Today, we celebrate Team Singapore’s achievements and also launch our campaign to 2015, which is also the year of our Golden Jubilee. Next year, we will see the return of the SEA Games and the debut of the ASEAN Para Games in Singapore – both held in our brand new National Stadium and Sports Hub. Our athletes will compete with the best in the region, and will strive to improve on their performances in Myanmar. Many have told me that they are making a special effort for the Games, because they are competing here at home, in front of our home crowd.

11. "More than just about sporting events, the Games are also about the hopes and dreams of individuals and communities. They are about the human spirit and our shared aspirations. The Games will bring together ordinary people with extraordinary dreams. So the theme we have chosen for the Games is to ‘Celebrate the Extraordinary’. Join us a participant, volunteer or spectator, and be part of this historic event. Remember, together we are stronger. Together, let us together celebrate the extraordinary, let’s show our Singapore spirit, and let’s make 2015 a truly extraordinary year for Singapore."

12. The 28th SEA Games will be held from 5-16 June 2015, and the 8th ASEAN Para Games are to be held in December in the same year.
