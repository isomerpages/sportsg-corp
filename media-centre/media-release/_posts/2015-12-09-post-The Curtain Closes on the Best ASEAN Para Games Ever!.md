### **The Curtain Closes on the Best ASEAN Para Games Ever!**
Following seven days of intense competition involving more than 2,500 athletes and officials from around the region, Singapore officially signed off on the 8th ASEAN Para Games 2015 with a rousing celebration for invited guests, athletes and officials.

In its 8th edition, the ASEAN Para Games was hosted by Singapore for the very first time, and followed the successful conclusion of the 28th Southeast Asian Games in June 2015. Over the past week, spectators, athletes and officials all over the region witnessed an extraordinary competition, with inspiring displays of grit, determination and tenacity.

The official Closing Ceremony was an intimate and joyful celebration, attended by 2,700 athletes, officials, sponsors, community partners and volunteers. Attendees were entertained by performances by students from Nan Hua High School, local dance group Dance Inspiration and Singapore’s Purple Orchestra, the nation’s first fully inclusive orchestra for people with disabilities.
 
In her closing speech for the 8th ASEAN Para Games, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, and Chairperson of the Singapore ASEAN Para Games Organising Committee, Ms Grace Fu, noted that the APG is not only about winning and sporting excellence, but about resilience and the indomitable human spirit.  
  
Minister Fu said, “One week ago, we set out to “Celebrate the Extraordinary”. Indeed, our athletes have shown us what it means to be truly – Extraordinary, and have given us fantastic performances that will stay in our minds for a long time.  
  
“It has been Singapore’s honour to host this Games. It has truly been our privilege to be touched and inspired by the courage and determination of our athletes.”  
  
Echoing similar sentiments, Dato Zainal Abu Zarin, President of ASEAN Para Sports Federation also noted that Singapore’s hosting of this edition of the ASEAN Para Games will set the benchmark for the future editions of the Games, as a demonstration of what the region can do to raise the standards of disability sport.  
  
Dato Zainal said, “Tonight’s closing ceremony marks the end of another great and inspiring Games - the 8th ASEAN Para Games will be remembered as the “Best Games Ever” in the Games’ 15-year history.  

“As we head towards 2020, lets us all work hard to empower our sports. Already, we have seen huge shifts and changes in the attitude, perception and treatment especially towards our athletes, and Persons with Disabilities. “We need to build on this momentum, and continue to synergise our strengths to ensure that Paralympic sports in our region continue to grow and bring positive changes to our society.

Ms Grace Fu handed the flag to Dato’ M. Saravanan, Deputy Youth and Sports Minister of the next host nation Malaysia. The Games was declared closed by Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
