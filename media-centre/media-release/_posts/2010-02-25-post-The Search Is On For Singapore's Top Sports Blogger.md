### **The Search Is On For Singapore's Top Sports Blogger**

_SSC ramps up its online engagement through social media_

**Singapore, 25 February 2010** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has accelerated its social media efforts with more interactive elements and tactics that will engage netizens to use their website and keep them logging back for more.

2. The efforts integrate Singaporesports.sg, the first stop local sports portal with Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and more to provide seamless information which all local sports enthusiasts desire.

3. One such initiative is the Star Sports Blogger competition which is open to all members of the public regardless of age. The search for the top Singapore sports blogger starts today and will go on for about three weeks.

4. Said Jose Raymond, Singapore Sports Council Deputy Director (Media Relations and Social Media): "After several months of monitoring and assessment, our Digital Media team will be implementing specific social media tactics to help the organisation better connect with the public. We want to engage users from where they work, live and play; and using social media tools is the way to do it. We will be coming out with new applications and interesting features on our sports portal.

5. "From the sports blogger competition, we will be able to identify potential sports bloggers that can stimulate conversation and interest around local sports and create an online sporting community."

6. This blogging competition aims to highlight the best sports bloggers in the blogosphere. The competition aims to challenge participants to creatively blog on anything related to local sports. This competition will allow them to show their flair and talent for blogging while giving them the recognition they deserve in the online blogging community.

7. The top three bloggers stand to win fantastic prizes with the top blogger receiving prizes worth over $2,500, and the recognition in the sports industry as its Singapore's first Star Sports Blogger.

8. Added Raymond: "It is our hope that we will attract online participants from all walks of life to adopt a sporting culture through this digital media platform. Through blogging and the use of online media, we are hoping that more sports fans are exposed to local sports news and discussions."

9. The Star Sports Blogger contest ends on 16 March 2010 and the results will be announced on 30 March 2010.
