### **Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2014 Unveils Revisions To Race Routes For A Smoother Running Experience**

_Improvements to reduce congestion points in the final 3km_

Participants in the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) 2014 can look forward to a smoother and more enjoyable run this year. The event organiser Spectrum Worldwide unveiled a significant amendment to the route which will reduce congestion at the merging point of various categories.

2\. At approximately 18km along the Half Marathon route, runners will get off the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) via the exit ramp leading to Maxwell Road. They will then make their way through the Central Business District via Robinson Road - Collyer Quay – Anderson Bridge, to finish at the Padang. This revised running route effectively separates the Half Marathon participants (more than 12,000 runners) from the Marathon and 10km runners, thereby significantly reducing the 3km congestion traditionally experienced in previous years.

3\. This also enables the Marathon and 10km participants to enjoy a clearer path along the Republic Boulevard - Raffles Ave – Esplanade Drive stretch – until the final 500m, where the runners of all three distance categories will merge just before Anderson Bridge, for their final journey to the finish line.

4\. Similar to previous editions, all categories will have wave starts to minimise crowding within the first few kilometres.

5\. “Feedback from participants has always been very important for us to continuously improve the race experience. Together with the relevant authorities, and with the full support of Sport Singapore and Standard Chartered Bank, we have made these changes to ensure a smoother running experience,” said Chris Robb, Chief Executive Officer, Spectrum Worldwide.

6\. “While SCMS accommodates runners of all abilities, a key priority for us is to provide an outstanding experience for our long distance runners. It is this group of runners who will benefit the most from the new route change and we’re very pleased to have found an effective solution,” he added.

7\. Marathon participants will also be happy to note that with the revised route, they will have the opportunity to run very close to and take in the magnificent sights around the Sports Hub.

8\. Registrations remain open for all categories until midnight on 31 October 2014. Late entries will still be accepted after this date but participants will pay a $20 late fee and will not receive a personalised race bib.
