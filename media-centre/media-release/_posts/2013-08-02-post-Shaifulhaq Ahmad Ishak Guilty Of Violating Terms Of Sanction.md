### **Shaifulhaq Ahmad Ishak Guilty Of Violating Terms Of Sanction**

*Bodybuilder to serve 2-year suspension from start*

**Singapore, 2 August 2013** - Bodybuilder Shaifulhaq Bin Ahmad Ishak has had his two-year ban from sports restarted following a violation of the terms of his sanction.

2. Shaifulhaq had been one of seven bodybuilders banned for two years from 6 August 2012 following in-competition testing by Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) at the 50th Singapore National Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship 2012 when he tested positive for the substances Drostanolone and Methylhexaenamine.

3. On 29 June 2013, in violation of his two-year period of ineligibility, Shaifulhaq competed in the 51st Singapore National Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship 2013 and won in the Middleweight category.

4. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, athletes who violate the terms of their period of ineligibility are subject to having their period of ineligibility restarted.

5. The athlete's participation in the championship was confirmed by the Singapore Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation (SBBF) President, Dr Rano Izhar Rahmat.

6. ADS issued a Notice of Apparent Violation to Shaifulhaq and he admitted participating in the championship.

7. A Review Panel comprising members from SSC's National Anti-Doping Advisory Board considered the facts of the case and found that Shaifulhaq showed little remorse for violating the period of ineligibility. The Panel has recommended that Shaifulhaq's two-year period of ineligibility be restarted from 29 June 2013 - the date of his participation in the 51st Singapore National Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship 2013. He will be ineligible to participate, as an athlete or support personnel, in any sport up to and including 28 June 2015. In addition, Shaifulhaq's results from the competition would be considered null and void.

8. The Review Panel has also found the SBBF guilty of breaching the agreement to adopt, abide and implement the ADS Anti-Doping Rules by intentionally lifting the suspension to allow the athlete to compete.`*`

9. Said Ms Yeo Say Po, General Manager of ADS, "In our commitment to keep sport doping-free, we cannot condone deliberate attempts of disrespect to the Anti-Doping rules. We have informed the Singapore Sports Council and the Singapore National Olympic Council regarding this serious breach by SBBF. We hope that appropriate action will be taken against them."

\*Under Anti-Doping Singapore's (ADS) Anti-Doping Rules, the National Anti-Doping Disciplinary Committee (NADC) decides on the sanctions on athletes who have violated the doping rules and regulations. The respective NSAs must implement the sanctions accordingly. All athletes were given a period to appeal to the National Anti-Doping Appeals Committee (NAAC) following NADC's decision. After this period, no one, including the ADS and the NSAs, has the right to lift the ban.
