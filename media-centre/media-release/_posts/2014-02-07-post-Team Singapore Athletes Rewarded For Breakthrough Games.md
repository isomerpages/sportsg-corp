The 27th SEA Games Myanmar 2013 will be remembered as one of many historic firsts for Team Singapore and today, the athletes who brought home the bounty of 34 Gold were rewarded with a total Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP) reward of S$400,000.

2\. The athletes received their awards this afternoon from Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) held at the Swissotel Merchant Court.

3\. “You not only gave us many moments to cheer and celebrate during the Games, but also made us cherish the journey you took to make our nation proud.” DPM Teo, who is also the Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs, added “More than half of our contingent were young debutants and they contributed to almost half of our total medal haul. This is a good sign that we have a strong pipeline of sportsmen and women. We look forward to their continued progress and success in the years to come.”

4\. Team Singapore’s swimmers ruled the pool in Naypyidaw and made the biggest splash at the Awards Ceremony in Swissotel Merchant Court, as they took home S$115,000 for their 11-Gold haul.

Together with my doubles partner, Suzanne, we are glad to be able to not only retain our K2 200m title, but bring back another victory for the team and make Singapore proud.”
