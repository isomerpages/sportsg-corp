### **Recognition for Team Singapore coaches for 29th SEA Games and 9th ASEAN Para Games achievements**

**Recognition for Team Singapore coaches for 29th SEA Games and 9th ASEAN Para Games achievements**  _105 National Coaches of SEA Games and APG medallists receive special medallion at inaugural Coaches Appreciation Night_  
   
**Singapore, 23 November 2017** - 105 coaches were recognised at the inaugural Coaches Appreciation Night for their role in Team Singapore’s breakthrough performances at the recent 29th SEA Games and 9th ASEAN Para Games.   
   
1. Organised by CoachSG, the event saw all head coaches of Team Singapore athletes and teams who medalled at the two Games in Kuala Lumpur presented with specially crafted medallions to celebrate the role they played in the successes of their charges.   
   
2. For the record, Team Singapore clinched a medal haul of 188 (57 Gold, 58 Silver and 73 Bronze) and 50 (9 Gold, 17 Silver and 24 Bronze) medals at the SEA Games and APG respectively, achieving our best away showing at both biennial events.   
   
3. The recognition of head coaches of medal-winning athletes from the Major Gamesi was announced at the launch of CoachSG in May.   
   
4. Troy Engle, Director of CoachSG, said, “As we met with coaches prior to the launch of CoachSG, it became clear that coaches, while highly valued by their athletes, didn’t receive the public acknowledgement and recognition they deserved because so much of their work is behind the scenes. On behalf of CoachSG, we would like to congratulate and commend our Team Singapore Coaches who were instrumental in the success of their athletes in a record year for Team Singapore.”  
   
5. Team Singapore paddler Jason Chee, who captured the imagination of the nation with his stirring Gold Medal win in the T2 Men’s Singles at the APG, acknowledged the vital role his coach Chia Chong Boon played in his eventful journey to the top of the podium. He said, “It takes a lot of patience and effort to train me, from helping me pick up the sport with my weaker right hand to constantly giving me positive pointers to improve my game. Coach Chia trained me well and I am really thankful for him.”  
   
6. Coach Chia reflected on Jason’s remarkable triumph, “This year marks my 8th year coaching the para athletes and a very special one with Jason winning the Gold medal at the ASEAN Para Games. I certainly did not expect that especially after he had lost his right eye to cancer, but his fighting spirit and will is indomitable and truly an inspiration to all Singaporeans. Receiving the medallion today was definitely an honour, but as his coach, what I am really proud of is to be able to share that winning moment with him and that moment will stick with me for life.”

7. Francis Yeo, who led the Men’s Bowling Team to a surprise victory in the Team of Five event at the SEA Games, was pleased to see the hard work among his fellow coaches recognised. He said, “This new initiative of giving a medallion to coaches with medalled athletes at the SEA Games and APG is good and I am sure my fellow coaches will feel a sense of appreciation and recognition. I was very proud for our National Men’s Team when they won the Gold medal. It was a team effort where the athletes, coaches, consultants, sport scientists and administrators who had worked in synergy to ensure our success.”  
   
8. Coach Yeo also paid tribute to the memory of former national bowler and coach Henry Tan – the 1984 and 2010 Coach of the Year. “The late Mr Henry Tan continues to serve as a role model for all of us as he was one coach that did everything for the players and the sport”.
