Jurong-Clementi Town Council has completed yet another HDB’s Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) project, comprising 2 HDB precincts ( Blocks 537 to 542 and 552 to 559 Jurong West Street 42).

The major highlight of this NRP is the revamp of the existing Neighbourhood Park at Jurong West Street 42, next to Blocks 548, 549, 556 and 558. In collaboration with the Sport Singapore’s Sport-In-Precinct programme (SIP programme), the park has been transformed into a Sports Recreation Hub – a unique community focal point that caters to various sporting and leisure activities that can be enjoyed by all age groups.  This is in tandem with the encouragement of a healthy and active lifestyle closer to home.
