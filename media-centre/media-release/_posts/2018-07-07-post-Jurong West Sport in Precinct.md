Jurong-Clementi Town Council has completed yet another HDB’s Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) project, comprising 2 HDB precincts ( Blocks 537 to 542 and 552 to 559 Jurong West Street 42).

The major highlight of this NRP is the revamp of the existing Neighbourhood Park at Jurong West Street 42, next to Blocks 548, 549, 556 and 558. In collaboration with the Sport Singapore’s Sport-In-Precinct programme (SIP programme), the park has been transformed into a Sports Recreation Hub – a unique community focal point that caters to various sporting and leisure activities that can be enjoyed by all age groups. This is in tandem with the encouragement of a healthy and active lifestyle closer to home.

Facilities at the hub include a Green Plateau with exercise and viewing deck on the upper level and a multi-purpose court and activity area on the lower level, Toddler and Adventure Playgrounds, multi-generations fitness corners, a futsal court, a jogging track, BBQ pits, etc. The covered multi-purpose court also serves as an ideal venue for community events and exercise sessions. At the request of residents, the Grassroots Advisor had also suggested the inclusion of a rubberised walking track that is suitable for the elderly.

We also hope that these amenities can foster better interaction among residents of different generations.

The Neighbourhood Park will also be the very first Active Health@SIP1 in Singapore that is specially designed to provide an endearing and creative space for the community. Leveraging on sport and exercise science concepts, this new facility can enhance the effective of park users’ workouts and create a deeper awareness on how people can take ownership of their health through the management of their four domains of physical activity, nutrition, sleep and screen time.

The other improvement works in this project include sheltered linkways, drop-off points, pavilions and barrier-free access between blocks, all geared towards the theme of “connectivity”.
