### **Target: 50,000 Well-Wishes For Team Singapore Athletes In 2010**

_Public Urged To Rally Behind Singapore Athletes As SSC-Milo National Well-Wishing Campaign Hits The Heartlands_

**Singapore, 2 July 2010** - Veteran and current Singapore sports champions gathered at the Health &amp; You Exhibition 2010 held at the Suntec City Convention Centre today to kick-start the SSC-MILO National Well-Wishing Campaign by personally delivering their well wishes to Team Singapore athletes who will be participating in the upcoming Games to be held in 2010 such as the Youth Olympic Games (YOG), the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, the Asian Games in Guangzhou, as well as other regional multi-sports events like the Asian Beach Games in Muscat.

2. Co-organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and MILO, the campaign aims to urge Singaporeans to send their wishes to Team Singapore athletes who will be representing the nation at the major multi-sporting events this year. The SSC hopes to gather more than 500,000 signatures and well-wishes from members of the public for Team Singapore athletes in 2010.

3. "This year is going to be an exceptional one for our athletes as it is rare to have a sporting calendar with three major Games in a year, among other world-class international and regional events. Our athletes have been training hard to prepare for these competitions. And what they need now is a lot of heartfelt encouragement from us," said Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO, Singapore Sports Council. "We want all our Team Singapore athletes to know that every Singaporean will be cheering for them as they reach for their dreams and make our nation proud. I urge all Singaporeans to join us at the SSC-MILO National Well-Wishing Campaign to pen their wishes to encourage our athletes."

4. In a move to garner as many signatures and well-wishes from members of the public as possible, the SSC and MILO created the "MILO Mobile", which will be a feature of the SSC-MILO National Well-Wishing Campaign. The "MILO Mobile" will be visiting more than 20 road shows from July to October 2010 to reach out to as many Singaporeans as possible from all walks of life. Other than its inaugural appearance at the Health &amp; You Exhibition 2010, other planned appearances include venues such as the East Coast Park, the National University of Singapore (NUS) and several National Library Board branches. More of such stops are being planned to encourage Singaporeans to pen down their well wishes for our athletes.

5. Members of the public who wish to send their wishes to Singapore's athletes can make their pledges at either the "MILO Mobile" road shows or online through www.SingaporeSports.sg/Wish. Well-wishers who send their pledges to Team Singapore in the SSC-MILO National Well-Wishing Campaign also stand a chance to win a pair of tickets to Greece.

6. The "MILO Mobile" comes equipped with four exciting sports stations such as football and basketball to fast-growing sports such as cycling and boxing which can be easily set-up for well-wishers to try out.

7. Former and current athletes present at the launch today, including Singapore sprint legend C Kunalan, sailor Teo Wee Chin and swimmers Mark Chay and Sng Ju Wei, were all praise for the new exciting SSC-MILO National Well-Wishing campaign and the "MILO Mobile".

8. "When I was an athlete, I was motivated to excel and push myself to greater limits knowing that my fellow Singaporeans were firmly behind me," said Mr C Kunalan, who was once Singapore's fastest man over 100 metres. His time of 10.38s set at the 1968 Mexico Olympics remained intact for 33 years till it was broken in 2001. "I am glad for this chance to extend my best wishes to my sporting compatriots and am confident that they will scale greater heights and achieve sporting glory for Singapore."

9. "Nestle MILO has been championing youth sports development in Singapore since the 1950s. Co-creating the "MILO Mobile" with the SSC as part of the SSC-MILO National Well-Wishing Campaign is part of our continued efforts to get Singaporeans interested in sports, and to embrace a healthier lifestyle through sports. The Health &amp; You Exhibition 2010 which is presented by Nestle, is the perfect platform to launch this campaign," said Mr Suresh Narayanan, Managing Director, Nestle Singapore.
