### **Asics Partners SSC To Deliver The SCMS As Asia's Pinnacle Race**

_ASICS to provide support on multiple platforms for the inaugural Marathon_

**Singapore, 5 May 2010** - Running enthusiasts, who are already looking forward to the inaugural Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2010, will be pleased to know that world's leading running brand, ASICS today signed up as the official apparel sponsor for the inaugural Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS). Under the three-year sponsorship agreement, from 2010 to 2012, ASICS will be equipping SCMS' participants, officials and volunteers with sporting apparel fit for Singapore's humid weather. The total value-in-kind sponsorship is valued at about S$11 million over three years.

2. As the organiser for the SCMS, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is working towards delivering a world-class marathon for all levels of runners come 5 December 2010. The ASICS sponsorship comes hot on the heels of the appointment of Dave McGillivray as SCMS 2010's Race Director. Dave has been the man behind the successful running of the Boston Marathon for 22 years, which is the world's oldest marathon and has been dubbed as the best race in the world.

3. "We are committed to bringing a world-class marathon experience for all runners at the new Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore in December this year. And having listened to runners' feedback over the years, we are pleased to be able to fulfil their wish with ASICS onboard. No other brand can lay claim to the fact that the majority of marathon runners worldwide wear ASICS apparel, especially their shoes," said Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer of the SSC. "We believe that ASICS is a great fit for Asia's pinnacle race. With its wealth of experience as apparel sponsor for leading marathons and its continuous research and technological innovation, ASICS will help equip our runners, volunteers and officials with sporting apparel that is suitable for Singapore's humid weather."

4. ASICS was established based on the principle of 'a sound mind in a sound body', which is the translation of the famous Latin phrase Anima Sana In Corpore Sano, or ASICS. The brand sponsors some 52 marathons around the world, including the New York City Marathon, Paris Marathon, Tokyo Marathon, Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon, Seoul International Marathon and many more.

5. Through the sponsorship, ASICS aims to reach out to more runners in the region and grow their market share in Asia and beyond. "Sponsoring the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore for three years will further elevate ASICS' position as a leading sports apparel label and also accelerate our business in this region. We look forward to expanding our footprint in this region and amongst runners through this strategic partnership," said Mr Edmond Chee, Chief Operating Officer of Runner's World Pte Ltd, distributor of ASICS' in Singapore and South East Asia.

6. In addition, as part of the sponsorship, officials from the SSC will have the opportunity to visit the Research Institute of Sports Science in Kobe, Japan, where more than 200 scientists study and analyse the movements of the human body and conduct tests on all kinds of materials, in order to enable professional and recreational athletes all over the world to perform better. The first team from the SSC will be leaving for a study trip to Kobe this month.

7. To commemorate the sponsorship, ASICS will be offering 15% discount off regular merchandise at ASICS Concept Stores, located at Paragon, #04-44A and Marina Square, #03-110 for participants of SCMS 2010 from 1 August to 4 December 2010.

**About ASICS**<br>
The history of ASICS began with the establishment of Onitsuka Co, Ltd. in 1949. According to a philosophy based on "bringing up sound youth through sports," the company has kept the tradition of specializing in manufacturing sports shoes by having original ideas and applying epoch-making techniques.

In 1977, the Onitsuka Co. Ltd. became ASICS. The name, an acronym, derives from Anima Sana In Corpore Sano, an old Latin phrase expressing the ancient ideal of "A Sound Mind in a Sound Body." It's not a tagline, it's a reason for being. It's a foundation, a goal, an inspiration. It's why we began and when we lose sight of it, is when we'll call it quits.

Today, ASICS continues to walk in Mr. Onitsuka's footsteps. ASICS prides itself on building the finest products for the sports enthusiast. The rigorous technical and quality standards of the brand's shoes, apparel and accessories are unmatched.
