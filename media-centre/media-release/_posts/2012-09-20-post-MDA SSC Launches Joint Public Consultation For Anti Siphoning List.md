**Singapore, 20 September 2012** - To ensure viewers in Singapore have the opportunity to access programmes of public interest and national significance on the free-to-air TV platforms, the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA) has put in place the anti-siphoning regime since 2003. This regime ensures that programmes that are of national interest and importance, such as the SEA Games and Asian Games, will not be walled off by pay-TV retailers, and are available for free-to-air (FTA) broadcasters to acquire and broadcast for the entire nation's enjoyment.

2\. While this will help protect consumers' interest on FTA channels, it must be noted that whether programmes on the anti-siphoning list are eventually shown on FTA channels is ultimately left to the commercial discretion of the FTA broadcaster.

3\. In order to ensure that the current anti-siphoning list is in line with market developments and consumer preferences, MDA and the Singapore Sports Council jointly launched a two-phase consultation on the proposed changes to the anti-siphoning regime.

4\. A consultative panel comprising representatives from the government, industry and a consumer group was convened in February to August this year to review and propose the changes to be made to the anti-siphoning regime. For the second phase, members of the public are invited to share their views on the proposed changes starting from today. The public consultation will close on 18 October 2012.
