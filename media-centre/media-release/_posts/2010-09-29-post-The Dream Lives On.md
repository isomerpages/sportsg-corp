THE DREAM LIVES ON
The National Stadium Commemorative Book
Singapore, September 29, 2010 - One of Singapore's iconic landmarks - the old National Stadium is making way for the construction of the new Sports Hub. Given its illustrious past, as well as its place in the hearts of many Singaporeans, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) commissioned a book and a video to document the heritage of the Stadium.

2. Since its official opening on 21 July 1973, the Stadium has seen many sports and non-sports events, and distinguished visitors, such as Pope John Paul II, Michael Jackson and the Boxing Great, Muhammad Ali. It carries with it a rich history and has played an important role in nation-building, hosting 18 National Day Parades since 1976.

3. The National Stadium has become part of Singaporeans' lives. It always gives a majestic feel to Singaporeans. It is a national icon filled with a strong sense of national spirit and national pride. It is a standing testament to how sports and sports venues play a crucial role in bonding our people.

4. After over 30 years of service to the nation, the National Stadium will be torn down to be redeveloped into the new Sports Hub. And it is an appropriate time for Singaporeans to own a piece of history - the commemorative book and video on the Grand Old Dame!

Formed in 1973, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is tasked with developing a holistic sports culture for the nation. The SSC creates opportunities for people to excel in sports; opportunities for people to be engaged in sports as, coaches, officials, volunteers or fans; and opportunities for people to do business in sports as sponsors and investors. The SSC has changed the way Singaporeans view and participate in sports. Through sports, we now have an enhanced national identity thanks to our sports participation programmes; greater national pride as a result of high performance results at international and regional games; and more diversified economic stability through our vibrant sports industry initiatives.
