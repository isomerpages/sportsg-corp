### **New Club to Increase Playing Opportunities For Singapore Floorball Community**  
   
Singapore Floorball is set for a boost as ActiveSG will be launching the latest in its stable of academies and clubs – the ActiveSG Floorball Club – to assist the Singapore Floorball Association to promote and develop the sport in Singapore.   
   
The announcement was made during the GetActive! Singapore Floorball competitions which saw players, private operators and administrators from the Floorball community come together at the Our Tampines Hub sports hall to support the club launch. Present at the event as Guest-of-Honour was Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and adviser to Tampines Grassroots Organisations.  
   
Mr Masagos said, “Floorball has gained tremendous traction in Singapore as it nurtures speed, agility and fast-paced strategies and thinking. At the same time, it emphasizes the important spirit of teamsmanship, builds camaraderieship among players, bringing them closer together and encouraging a tight-knit community. Such are the types of sports and activities that we want to bring and celebrate at Our Tampines Hub because it serves as a bonding platform for residents in Tampines GRC.”  
   
Floorball is a sport that has skyrocketed in popularity over the past few years - there are currently about 15,000 Floorball players in Singapore coming from more than 100 schools and 100 clubs. The inclusive sport can also be modified for People with Disabilities to play and earlier this year, Singapore sent a team  to participate in the Special Olympics World Winter Games.

**Opening up more venues for Floorball**  

As more people take up Floorball, the demand for venues that offer both space and equipment needed to play a match has also increased. As such, the ActiveSG Floorball Club will be reaching out to local schools to encourage them to open up their Dual-Use Scheme indoor sports hall for Floorball usage after school hours and during the weekend.  
   
Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO of Sport Singapore said, “Beyond programming, our ActiveSG clubs and academies also partner our NSAs to synergise efforts to promote the sport. The efforts of the Singapore Floorball Association have been commendable and we want to partner them through the ActiveSG Floorball Club to realise the full potential of the sport in Singapore.”  
   
“There are currently many schools under the Dual-Use scheme that already have the equipment needed to organise a Floorball match. We will be reaching out to these schools to encourage them to open up their indoor sports halls outside of school hours for Floorball teams to train and play there,” he added.  
   
**More programmes and competitions**  

Additionally, the ActiveSG Floorball Club will be working closely with the Singapore Floorball Association to organise Learn-To-Play programmes as well as competitions that will provide more opportunities for the local Floorball community to play and retain a life-long interest in the sport.   
   
While the ActiveSG Floorball Club will provide facility support to drive the operational aspects of the programmes, they will also tap on the knowledge and technical expertise of the Singapore Floorball Association to provide coaches and develop the programme curriculum.  
   
Mr Kenneth Ho, President of the Singapore Floorball Association said, “Our partnership with the ActiveSG Floorball Club will help us build on the strong foundations that are already set in place and gradually expose more people to Floorball. With more opportunities for Singaporeans to learn, play and develop their passion for the sport, we hope to amass not just a pool of players that can rival Asia’s best in the near future; but also a spectatorship that can match the other popular sports in the country.”
