<p><strong>Singapore, 2 April 2025 </strong>– Sport Singapore (SportSG) marked
a milestone in Singapore’s high performance sport (HPS) ecosystem, with
the<strong> </strong>High Performance Sport Institute (HPSI)<strong> </strong>taking
effect from 1 April 2025. Formed through the integration of the Singapore
Sport Institute (SSI) and National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI), the HPSI
will provide a more seamless and structured High Performance Sport (HPS)
journey for athletes, parents and National Sports Associations (NSAs).
By streamlining the youth-to-senior athlete transition and strengthening
athlete development, HPSI aims to nurture more sporting talents in Singapore
that can compete at elite levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This integration helps to achieve Singapore’s vision for the next bound
of sporting excellence, as outlined by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong at
last year’s National Day Rally. As part of the Kallang Alive Master Plan,
the home of TeamSG will integrate the high-performance sporting development
in one campus so that athletes can stay, train, study and compete – and
repeat, until excellence becomes intuition. While the physical infrastructure
will take time to materialise, we will jumpstart the progress now by taking
steps to organise our HPS institutions around an integrated structure that
will drive Singapore’s sporting ambitions to new heights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the HPSI, Singapore’s sport science and sport medicine capabilities
will be further strengthened with more professional development opportunities
such as deployment across different sports and profiles of athletes. Touchpoints
with key stakeholders involved through an athlete’s life, such as parents
and NSAs, will also be streamlined to develop a more centrally-coordinated
pathway that can provide better visibility and assurance to the athletes,
not just for their sporting development but also post-sports career pathways.
HPSI will also work closely with the NSAs to support their professionalism
and capability development for better administration and governance.</p>
<p>HPSI will be led by Dr. Su Chun Wei, former Chief of SSI and Director
of NYSI, who brings deep expertise in athlete development, sport science
and high performance management. His leadership team comprises seasoned
professionals with extensive experience in Singapore’s HPS system.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Su Chun Wei, Chief, HPSI,</strong> said, “The integration of
our National Youth Sports Institute and Singapore Sport Institute into
our new High Performance Sport Institute marks the next milestone in Singapore’s
high performance sport system. By bringing together our collective expertise
and integrating our support systems to be more athlete-centric, globally
competitive and future-focused, we aim to better support our TeamSG athletes
to thrive at every stage of their development, so that they will be in
the best position to perform well, fly the Singapore flag high and inspire
our fellow Singaporeans.</p>
<p><strong>A Unified and Robust High Performance Sport System</strong>
</p>
<p>HPSI consolidates key capabilities in sport science, sport medicine, and
career transition support to deliver a more structured, end-to-end athlete
development system. Serving as a single point of contact for key stakeholders
within the High Performance sport ecosystem<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, HPSI will focus on creating an athlete-centric
Daily Training Environment, enhancing athlete pathways, and strengthening
governance to support Team Singapore athletes in achieving high performance
sport success to inspire and unite the nation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The institute is structured into dedicated teams that oversee HPS strategy
and policy, governance and assurance, business development, sport science
and sport medicine, coaching development, athlete lifestyle management
and overall HPS management. These teams will provide functional support
across various parts of the HPS landscape, including HPS policy and spexSchemes,
NSA relations and governance, TeamSG brand development, national training
systems integration, data analytics and performance analysis, performance
coaching and coach education, high performance athlete lifestyle support
for a more robust high-performance sporting landscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The consolidation of HPSI and Singapore Sports School will take place
at a later date and more details will be shared when ready. These changes
will strengthen the foundation of our future HPS system and together with
the Home of TeamSG, provide a holistic plan benefiting athletes, coaches,
parents, NSAs, and sport administrators and professionals.
