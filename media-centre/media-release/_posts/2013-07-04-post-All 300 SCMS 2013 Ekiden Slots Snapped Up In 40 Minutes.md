Singapore, 4 July 2013 - The ever popular team-based Ekiden category proved once again to be the bestseller at the launch of the 2013 edition of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS). Even with the increase in Ekiden slots to 300 this year, it took less than an hour to fill up all available slots. Registration kicked off at 11.00am this morning at The Event Square, Waterfront Promenade @ Marina Bay, where people started to queue as early as 8.30am yesterday morning to secure their running slot.

2. "We are very encouraged with the continued strong response to the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore, especially for the Ekiden race category where all slots have been taken up. It reinforces the marathon as the pinnacle running event in Singapore. As the only IAAF Gold Label event in Singapore, we will strive to ensure another quality event come 1 December 2013," said Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and Chairman of the SCMS 2013 Organising Committee.

3. SCMS 2013 has made provision for 62,000 slots - up from 60,000 offered last year - with the Half Marathon category accounting for the additional 2,000 slots being made available. When the launch event registration closed at 4pm today, more than 2,500 runners have already registered their participation. Online registration will commence at 6pm today (Thursday, 4 July 2013) on the official SCMS website [www.marathonsingapore.com](www.marathonsingapore.com)

4. The launch was officiated by Guest-of-Honour, Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, Mr Lawrence Wong, who, together with Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, SSC; Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, SSC; and Mr Ray Ferguson, Chief Executive, Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore, released helium-filled golden balloons - with encouraging messages attached - into a specially constructed giant tree-shaped cone structure. This was proceeded by hundreds more green and blue balloons filling the cone structure, each with messages written by participants waiting in line to register.

5. Mr Ray Ferguson, Chief Executive, Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore, said: "Standard Chartered Bank is proud to have played a part in nurturing Singapore's passion for running. This is the 12th year that the Bank is the title sponsor of Singapore's pinnacle running event. The passion, courage, and determination of the runners each year resonate strongly with what we stand for as an organisation. Just as the runners are determined to finish the race, we are committed in our partnership with the SSC to deliver a quality race for all. This is very much part of our DNA and what we set out in our brand promise to be Here for good in the communities where we operate."

**NEW SPONSORS**

6. While Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore continues to be the event's title sponsor, SCMS 2013 sees two prominent additions to its sponsorship portfolio this year.

7. Luxury Swedish automaker, Volvo, takes over the reins as SCMS 2013's official car. Known for its support of lifestyle pursuits, Volvo is the ideal fit for Singapore's marquee sporting event.

8. International sports apparel brand, Brooks, also comes onboard as official apparel sponsor, bringing with it a taste of the creative innovation that has garnered them a strong following among runners worldwide.

9. Both Volvo and Brooks join other longstanding event sponsors including Prudential, Seiko, Tiger Balm Active, StarHub, and many others.

**REGISTRATION PROCEEDS TO BENEFIT SPORTCARES**

10. This year, SCMS 2013 will donate S$2 from every participant's registration fee to SportCares, a new philanthropic organisation dedicated to use sport as a force for social good. Through the SCMS 2013 registration, the Singapore Sports Council hopes to raise at least S$100,000, which will go toward SportCares' programmes and activities for underprivileged children and youth at risk. Furthermore, donors can also contribute individually through the Give.Asia fundraising portal to pledge their run and raise funds for SportCares.

11. Added Mr Lim: "SportCares was set up to improve access and opportunities for people who lacked the resources to participate in and grow through well-designed sport. With the money raised, we will be able to do more through our SportCares' programmes to help people push beyond the limits of their experience and discover their true potential. I hope that SCMS 2013 will lead the way and inspire more individuals and future sports events organisers to support the SportCares movement."

**About 100 Plus**

Singapore's No. 1 isotonic drink, 100PLUS, was launched in 1984 to satisfy the growing demand for a sports-based beverage. This specially formulated 'thirst and body-quencher' helps to replenish lost fluids and combat the effects of dehydration, heats, and exertion - supporting you while achieving peak performance in your active lifestyle.
