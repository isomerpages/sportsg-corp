### **Wear your national pride on your sleeves with the One Team Singapore Collection**

With the upcoming 2016 sports season lined up with activities such as the GetActive! Singapore week of National Day celebrations through sport, dENiZEN™ has launched the 3rd edition of Singapore Jersey and a new range of One Team Singapore apparel with the largest collection of designs yet.  
  
Riding on the outpouring of support and success at the SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games hosted by Singapore last year, the collaboration seeks to continue to encourage Singaporeans to ‘wear their pride as One Team Singapore’ as they celebrate National Day, join in the various sporting celebration activities, and support our athletes in upcoming competitions at home and abroad.  
  
The lightweight series comes in cotton and micro fibre material with 14 different designs, consisting of the limited edition Singapore Jerseys (RSP: $19.90), OneTeamSG Jerseys and the sport series (RSP: $16.90). The sports series includes various sport-related designs such as Athletics, Badminton, Rowing, Sailing, Swimming and Table Tennis. Five designs will be available in kids’ range as well. dENiZEN™ has pledged to donate two percent from the total net proceeds of the One Team Singapore collection to the SportCares Foundation.  
  
Mr R Dhinakaran, Managing Director of Jay Gee Enterprises Pte Ltd said: “dENiZEN™ is excited about this first ever sports collaboration with Team Singapore as we are very supportive of sports and local talents being involved in such youthful activities”.  
  
Team Singapore athletes who will be fronting the dENiZEN™ collection campaign are Basketballer Chase Tan, Netballer Charmaine Soh, Silat exponent Muhammad Shakir Juanda, Shuttler Tay Wei Ming and Track athlete Dipna Lim Prasad.  
  
“As athletes, the support from Singaporeans is very important for us as it gives us a huge lift whenever we go onto court to compete. Just like the pride we get from wearing our national team jerseys, we look forward to seeing Singaporeans join us as One Team Singapore in a very visible way – by wearing one of these shirts”, said Team Singapore Netballer Soh.  
  
Mr Toh Boon Yi, Chief, Strategic Development & Marketing Group, Sport Singapore said, “We are delighted to have the support of a retailer like dENiZEN™ to join us as One Team Singapore. There is a design for everyone in the family and in the lead-up to GetActive! Singapore and National Day, there is no better way for Singaporeans to show their pride for our country and our Team Singapore athletes.”  
  
The dENiZEN™ One Team Singapore collection is available from today at all Denizen stores around the island.
