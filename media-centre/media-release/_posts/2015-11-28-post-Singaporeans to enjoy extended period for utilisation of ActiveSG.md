### **Singaporeans to enjoy extended period for utilisation of ActiveSG**
All Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) will now have more time and opportunities to utilise the ActiveSG$100 that they received in April last year, following an extension of validity as announced today.  
  
With the launch of the national movement for sport last year, Singaporeans and PRs who signed up for a membership were given $100 worth of credits to book sport facilities or sign up for programmes at all ActiveSG Sports Centres islandwide. Originally, members were given up to 31 December of the following year to utilise their ActiveSG$1 .  
  
With the extension, ActiveSG members will benefit as follows:  
  
(i) Sign-ups in 2014  
As a gesture of appreciation for their support, the utilisation period for ActiveSG Dollars will be automatically extended by an additional year to 31 December 2016.  
  
(ii) All sign-ups before 2017  
Utilisation period for ActiveSG Dollars will be extended by an additional year, as long as at least one transaction has been made in the year of expiry2 .  
  
The move was in an effort to support Singaporeans and Permanent Residents in their journey to lead an active lifestyle through sport, said Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. She announced the extension at the ActiveSG U21 Ultimate Frisbee Competition held at Yio Chu Kang today.  
  
Said Ms Sim: “Through ActiveSG, we want to encourage Singaporeans from all walks of life, regardless of age, skill level or physical ability, to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. We are heartened by the encouraging response – nearly a million have signed up since its launch last year. I’m pleased to announce that we are extending the validity of the ActiveSG$100, so that our members can continue to stay active. They can also look forward to more engaging and innovative programmes in the coming year. I urge all Singaporeans to join ActiveSG, and live better through sport!”  
  
The Ultimate Frisbee Competition held today is among many activities rolled out by ActiveSG to engage different segments of the community. Since its launch in April 2014, ActiveSG has run more than 5,000 activities to date – ranging from studio programmes such as Piloxing and innovative offerings such as Aqua Spinning, to school holiday programmes, sport and leadership camps, as well as multi-sport competitions. ActiveSG plans to continue expanding on the suite of activities available to members.  
  
To date, ActiveSG has received encouraging response from the public. It has over 920,000 members to date, with over 60% of members having utilised their credits. The purchase of swim and gym entry passes as well as the booking of sports facilities remain the top few transactions among members.  
  
1 Originally, members who received their ActiveSG$100 in April 2014 would have up to 31 December 2015 to utilise their credits, for example.   
  
2 With the extension, members who receive their ActiveSG$100 in January 2016 for example will now have up to 31 December 2018 (instead of 31 December 2017) to utilise their credits, as long as at least one transaction has been made in the year of expiry.   
  
  
About ActiveSG  
  
As a key recommendation of Vision 2030 – Singapore’s master plan for sports, ActiveSG was launched in April 2014 as the national movement for sport. ActiveSG aims to create a sporting ecosystem that provides innovative and experiential sport related programmes at sports centres island-wide. This movement will act as an enabler to build a community for individuals, families and organisations from different zones where Singaporeans can come together to learn, train, compete and host a range of sports. Working together with communities, National Sports Associations (NSAs), schools, corporations, public agencies and interest groups, ActiveSG aims to co-create programmes that are affordable and inclusive for all skill levels and age groups.
