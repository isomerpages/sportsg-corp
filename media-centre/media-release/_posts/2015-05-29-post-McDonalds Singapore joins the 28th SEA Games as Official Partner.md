### **McDonald's Singapore joins the 28th SEA Games as Official Partner**

McDonald’s Singapore today announced its sponsorship of the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games. As the Official Partner, McDonald’s Singapore aims to raise public awareness and support for Team Singapore athletes.

**Raising Awareness for Team Singapore**

McDonald’s Singapore aims to build affinity between Singaporeans and Team Singapore via a four-part advertorial series in Singapore’s The Straits Times. The weekly series, which will feature local athletes from four different generations, kicked off on 10 May 2015.

McDonald’s will also be promoting the 28th SEA Games and cheering for Team Singapore through its social media channels: Facebook, LINE, and Instagram.

**Bringing SEA Games excitement to more than 50,000 McDonald’s Surprise Alarm app users daily**

Bringing some SEA Games excitement to McDonald’s Surprise Alarm App users, McDonald’s will be adding an exciting variety of e-coupons to the app’s mix of surprises. Selected surprises will include interesting facts on some of Singapore’s athletes such as Athlete Glory Barnabas, Swimmer Ang Peng Siong and Footballer Fandi Ahmad.

From 22 May - 16 June, users also stand to win:

* Collect to Win vouchers, which users simply collect a series of vouchers to redeem an Extra Value Meal

* E-coupons to redeem free treats and promotional deals at McDonald’s. These include free McChicken as well as Buy One Get One offers

Free to download on Apple’s App Store and Google Play, the McDonald’s Surprise Alarm App wakes users up with daily surprises including Food and Beverage e-coupons and a variety of fun content. Users simply set a daily alarm using the app and one surprise will be dispensed each time the alarm goes off. Users will only receive one surprise a day.

“The 28th SEA Games is a significant one for Singapore as it coincides with the nation’s 50th birthday,” said Robert Hunghanfoo, Managing Director, McDonald’s Singapore. “We hope to enhance the SEA Games experience for Singaporeans by raising awareness of Team Singapore and by recognising our athletes.”

Toh Boon Yi, Chief of Community and Corporate Outreach, Singapore SEA Games Organising Committee said, “We are pleased to have McDonald’s come on board as a 28th SEA Games sponsor. The work that McDonald’s is doing to enhance public affinity with Team Singapore athletes, who are training hard to bring pride to Singapore, is heartening and we hope that Singaporeans will come out in full force to support our athletes ‘live’ at the Games.”

This over $250,000 sponsorship is part of McDonald’s ongoing commitment to encourage balanced and active lifestyles through the endorsement of sports. In 2012, three children from Singapore were selected under the McDonald’s Champion of Play programme and personally experienced the excitement of the London Olympic Games. One of these children, Lau Ywen, is a member of the Singapore National Fencing Squad. Ywen drew great inspiration from her time at the London Games and her experience as a McDonald's Champion of Play as she represented Singapore in many championships, including the 17th Asian Games where, at age 14, she was the youngest fencer in the Games. Now 15, Ywen is the youngest member of Singapore's SEA Games fencing team and she will fence both the Women Sabre individual and team events next month.

During Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, three Singapore youths were given special opportunities to the Games and Youth Olympic Village to interview local and international Olympic youth athletes under the McDonald’s Young Journalists Programme. McDonald’s is also the exclusive presenter of the annual Olympic Day Run in collaboration with the Singapore National Olympic Council.
