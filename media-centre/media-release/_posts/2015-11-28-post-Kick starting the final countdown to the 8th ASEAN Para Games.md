### **Kick starting the final countdown to the 8th ASEAN Para Games**

The 8th ASEAN Para Games (APG) will officially open in five days and APG fever is at an all-time high.As the finishing touches go up at the Games Village to ensure a pleasant stay for all athletes and officials, visitors to the Singapore Sports Hub will also experience the extraordinary at the APG Carnival.

**12 days of fun-filled experiences at the APG Carnival**

Today, the fun-for- the-family APG Carnival kicked off at the Sports Hub. Until 9 December 2015, visitors to the Sports Hub will experience some unique and engaging family fun at the carnival, featuring an eclectic mix of 21 activities for audiences of all ages.

“With the APG happening during the December school holidays, we want to create memorable experiences for the entire family. The APG is about inclusiveness, and through the carnival activities, families can try out first-hand and learn more about para sports and the challenges faced by persons with disability in fun and engaging ways. Besides participating in the carnival activities, we hope this will encourage members of the community to cheer on our athletes as they compete with the region’s best on home ground, making this a fitting SG50 finale.” said Ms Lee Huei Chern, Head, Marketing, Communications and Engagement, SAPGOC.

Activities at the carnival are divided into four main zones – the Para Experience Zone, Para Sports Tryouts, Kids and Inflatable Zone, and the ActiveSG Experience Zone with something fun for everyone!

**Athletes and officials can expect a well-equipped Games Village**

On the other hand, the Games Village, located at the iconic Marina Bay Sands, will house approximately 3,000 athletes and officials, in 1,300 hotel rooms, for the duration of the Games (3 - 9 December 2015).

Beyond the accommodation point for APG athletes, Marina Bay Sands will also feature a large concentration of activities– from hosting competitions across four sports (Goalball, Football 5-a-side, Powerlifting, Sailing) to providing work spaces for delegates.

A total of 390 rooms at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel have been retro-fitted to provide the best experience for APG athletes and officials. These rooms will see fixed shower heads with an extendable hose allowing care-givers to support athletes and officials where necessary. Besides lodge and board, athletes and delegates will also enjoy the hotel’s facilities such as the swimming pool, gym and business centre. Athletes will also get access to the Games Medical Centre located in Tower 3.

SAPGOC’s Chief of Client Services Rostam Umar said, “We are in the final stretch of preparations and are happy with what we have so far at the Games Village. We chose MBS because it allows us to locate all our key services under one roof. The athletes’ dining hall, competition halls and transport hall for example are on the same floor, adding to the ease of moving around within the Games Village. The Games Village is also in close proximity to the Sports Hub – where most of the other competitions are held.” 

Ian Wilson, Senior Vice President, Hotel Operations, Marina Bay Sands, echoed the same sentiments, “Marina Bay Sands is excited to be the Official Games Village of Singapore’s historic 8th ASEAN Para Games. The integrated resort is gearing up and working closely with the organizing committee to ensure a seamless experience for the athletes who will be arriving next week. Over 3,000 athletes and officials are staying at our Hotel, and to facilitate easy wheelchair access, we are putting the finishing touches in some hotel rooms by retrofitting the bathroom facilities and widening the spaces between the twin beds.

For the first time, we have transformed a whole level of hotel rooms in Tower 3 into medical suites. With medical facilities under the same roof, it will be more convenient for the athletes to access round-the-clock medical expertise. The athletes’ dining hall, located right beside the competition hall at Sands Expo and Convention Centre, will also see lowered buffet lines for the athletes and some 14,000 meals are expected to be prepared throughout the whole period. We have also designated a special transport hall, adjacent to the competition halls, so that it is easier for the athletes to shuttle between Sports Hub and Marina Bay Sands.”
