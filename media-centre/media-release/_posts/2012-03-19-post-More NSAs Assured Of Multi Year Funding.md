### **More NSAs Assured Of Multi-Year Funding**


**Singapore, 19 March 2012** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced that more National Sports Associations (NSAs) received in-principle approval for multi-year funding for Financial Year (FY) 2012 compared to FY 2011 under its Annual NSA Grant Exercise (ANGE). The move is in line with SSC's emphasis to help NSAs realise their medium-term strategies.

2\. For ANGE FY 2012, 29 NSAs received in-principle funding approval for their initiatives and programmes up to three years out, almost a 40% increase from FY 2011 (21 NSAs).

3\. Commenting on ANGE FY 2012, Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer of the SSC said, "NSA multi-year planning was introduced in 2009 as part of a collaborative effort to improve the capabilities of our NSAs. Multi-Year Sports Plans (MYSP) and assured funding give NSAs more confidence that they will receive support for programmes which run over longer cycles. As we implement the Vision 2030 recommendations it will become even more important that we think through our medium to long term strategies."

4\. In-principle approval for multi-year funding is granted when NSAs demonstrate that they have the corresponding support structures in place to deliver the MYSPs, such as strong corporate governance policies and practices, as well as the ability to meet their KPIs.

5\. SSC will be channeling S$62.48 million (FY2011: $62 million) in FY2012 (1 April 2012 - 31 Mar 2013) to NSAs and other sports partners under ANGE FY 2012.

6\. "Champions are not made overnight. For Singapore to be able to produce champions on a sustainable basis, we need to have a sports pathway - where we can identify talents, shape them through structured training and competition programmes under competent coaches, and provide excellent sports science and medicine support. This requires long-term planning backed by the certainty of funding. We are happy to note that many NSAs have answered the call and that more are submitting credible, holistic and implementable MYSPs this year," said Bob Gambardella, SSC's Chief of Sports Development Group and Singapore Sports Institute.

7\. The MYSP incorporates programmes from mass participation to talent identification to high performance development.
