### **Team Singapore Begins Journey Towards The Asian Games and The Asian Para Games**
Close to 300 Team Singapore athletes and officials gathered at a flag presentation ceremony to commemorate their journey towards inspiring the nation at the Asian Games and the Asian Para Games between September and October 2014 in Incheon, Korea.

2\. Guests of Honour Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, Minister for Manpower and President, Singapore National Olympic Council and Mr Sam Tan, Minister of State, Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth presented the Singapore flags as a symbol of honour to the flag bearers for the respective Games.

##### **2014 Asian Games**

3\. Opening the second lap of the Games season is the 2014 Asian Games, which will take place in Incheon, Korea from 19 September to 4 October. Singapore will be fielding a contingent of 227 athletes to compete in 20 sports, led by Chef De Mission (CDM) Mrs Jessie Phua. 

4\. Says Mrs Jessie Phua: “Participating in international competitions can be a very stressful experience. After years of training, and much blood, sweat and tears, this can be said to be the moment of truth for our athletes. We have in our midst, sporting ambassadors who are prepared to do their best and do Singapore proud. In times like these, the strong support of family, friends and fellow Singaporeans can help to share the athlete’s burden, so as to bring out the champion inside of them. I look forward to leading them to deliver inspirational performances that will do the nation proud."

##### **2014 Asian Para Games**

5\. Shortly after the Asian Games is the Asian Para Games, held in Incheon, Korea from 18 to 24 October 2014.This multi-sport event will see some 53 athletes representing Singapore in 11 sports and led by Chef De Mission (CDM) Mr M. Lukshumayeh. 

6\. “Our para-athletes have been giving us many inspirational moments by proving their mettle at previous Games. Many of them have shown that by having the right mindset and attitude, and with the right form of support, you will be able to overcome any form of challenges – both physical and mental. Through the Asian Para Games, I hope that our para-athletes can gain more competition experience in preparation for next year’s ASEAN Para Games in Singapore so as to realise Singapore’s paralympic aspirations.” said Mr M. Lukshumayeh.

##### **Call for Singaporeans to support our athletes**

7\. In the spirit of coming together as one Team Singapore, Minister Tan Chuan-Jin acknowledged the important role supporters play in every athlete’s endeavor. This includes the backroom support staff, families and friends who have invested their time and resources to support the athletes. He stressed that everyone has a role to play in contributing to a vibrant sports culture and that everyone should keep the momentum going to be a stronger Team Singapore when Singapore hosts the 2015 SEA Games.

8\. Says Asian Para Games flag bearer Jovin Tan, “It is always an honour to be selected to represent Singapore in international competitions and it is an even greater honour to be able to be the flag bearer for Asian Para Games. I know that all eyes will be on me and my fellow athletes at the Games, but with the support of Singaporeans cheering me on, I am looking forward to doing my best and doing Singapore proud.”

9\. Sharing the same sentiment is Team Singapore sailor Loh Jia Yi. He adds, “As a first time participant to the Asian Games, I feel a sense of pride to have been given this opportunity. I know the competition is going to be tough, but with Team Singapore’s support, it will help me overcome all obstacles that will be presented during the race and to reach the common goal – that is, to be able to fly the Singapore flag high.”
