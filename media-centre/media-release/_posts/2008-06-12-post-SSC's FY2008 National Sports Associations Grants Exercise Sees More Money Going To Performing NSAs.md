<p>Outcome-based funding model, into its 3rd year, demands greater accountability,
ownership and results from NSAs</p>
<p>The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today at its Annual National
Sports Associations' (NSAs) Grants Exercise media conference that funding
to NSAs, starting from FY2008, will go towards performing NSAs.</p>
<p>In line with the outcome-based funding model introduced in FY2006, NSAs
would have to take greater accountability and ownership to deliver results
for their sports or risk having their funding reduced in the coming years.</p>
<p>For FY2008, NSAs will receive a total of about S$32.4 million worth of
direct grants to fund their sports programmes, up from S$31.9 million in
FY2007.</p>
<p>SSC's Chief Executive Officer, Oon Jin Teik said, "The outcome-based funding
model was introduced in FY2006 to drive NSAs to take greater accountability
and ownership to deliver results in the areas of sports participation,
excellence and industry. With the increasing sports opportunities in Singapore
and limited resources available, we must allocate our resources towards
the NSAs that show credible, consistent and sustainable plans to deliver
results over the short, medium and long term."</p>
<p>Key outcomes expected from the NSAs for FY2008 include achieving continued
success at major international games and competitions such as the 2008
Olympic Games and 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games, improving the quality
of high participation programmes, and continued emphasis on youth participation
for the majority of NSAs' programmes and events.</p>
<p>In addition to the S$32.4 million worth of direct grants in FY2008 to
fund NSAs sports programmes, SSC will also make provisions of S$1.47 million
to support viable programmes and new opportunities that the NSAs may have
during the fiscal year.</p>
<p>The NSAs will also continue to receive indirect grants. For FY2008, the
amount allocated is S$14.93 million, consisting of Athlete Development
(S$3.47 million), Sports Medicine and Sports Science (S$4.75 million),
Sports Education Programme<sup> (1)</sup> /Sports Partnership Promotion
Programme<sup> (2) </sup>(S$3.98 million) and subsidies for facilities
(S$2.73 million).</p>
<p>The SSC also announced a few new initiatives related to its funding policy.</p>
<p><strong>Matching Grant Scheme to Encourage Smaller NSAs to Tap on Sponsorship Market</strong> 
<br>
</p>
<p>Under a pilot scheme, NSAs that receive an annual grant allocation of
S$300,000 or less will be eligible for a matching grant. The matching grant
is an incentive-based strategy to encourage NSAs to tap on commercial revenue,
raise their own funds and be self-sustaining. The grant is applicable only
to new commercial cash sponsorships that the NSA secures or an increased
sponsorship quantum from an existing sponsor. Administered on a first-come-first-served
basis (a total of $200,000 has been set aside for FY2008), the matching
grant will be subjected to a maximum cap of S$20,000 per NSA per annum.
This matching grant is over and above the FY2008 annual grant that the
NSAs have received. Based on the funding allocation in FY2008, 38 NSAs
qualify for this scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing of Secretariat Grants</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>SSC will undertake a review of funding for NSAs' secretariats by studying
best practices overseas and employing a Human Resource consultant to assess
headcount needs and salary benchmarking for NSAs. This would include the
possibility of providing shared secretariat services to similar NSAs and
will commence in FY2009.</p>
<p><strong>NSAs to Draw On the Sports Education Programme</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>NSAs can tap on the SSC's Sports Education Programme (SEP) as an additional
means of funding. In order to do this, the NSA has to get its sports programme
endorsed by the SEP panel. Once this is done the NSA can be a sports service
provider and offer the programme to the schools. The applications for programme
endorsement for SEP 2009 (1 January - 31 December 2009) are opened from
16 June to 31 July 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Footnote:</strong>
</p>
<p><sup>1 </sup>The SSC introduced the SEP in primary schools to junior colleges
in April 2007 to encourage sports participation in schools and increase
sporting opportunities for the young.</p>
<p><sup>2 </sup>An initiative by the Singapore Sports Council aimed at generating
more sporting opportunities through the support and assistance of partners'
and service providers' events or programmes that are open for public participation.</p>
