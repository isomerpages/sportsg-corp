### **SSC's FY2008 National Sports Associations Grants Exercise Sees More Money Going To Performing NSAs**

Outcome-based funding model, into its 3rd year, demands greater accountability, ownership and results from NSAs

The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today at its Annual National Sports Associations' (NSAs) Grants Exercise media conference that funding to NSAs, starting from FY2008, will go towards performing NSAs.

In line with the outcome-based funding model introduced in FY2006, NSAs would have to take greater accountability and ownership to deliver results for their sports or risk having their funding reduced in the coming years.

For FY2008, NSAs will receive a total of about S$32.4 million worth of direct grants to fund their sports programmes, up from S$31.9 million in FY2007.

SSC's Chief Executive Officer, Oon Jin Teik said, "The outcome-based funding model was introduced in FY2006 to drive NSAs to take greater accountability and ownership to deliver results in the areas of sports participation, excellence and industry. With the increasing sports opportunities in Singapore and limited resources available, we must allocate our resources towards the NSAs that show credible, consistent and sustainable plans to deliver results over the short, medium and long term."

Key outcomes expected from the NSAs for FY2008 include achieving continued success at major international games and competitions such as the 2008 Olympic Games and 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games, improving the quality of high participation programmes, and continued emphasis on youth participation for the majority of NSAs' programmes and events.

In addition to the S$32.4 million worth of direct grants in FY2008 to fund NSAs sports programmes, SSC will also make provisions of S$1.47 million to support viable programmes and new opportunities that the NSAs may have during the fiscal year.

The NSAs will also continue to receive indirect grants. For FY2008, the amount allocated is S$14.93 million, consisting of Athlete Development (S$3.47 million), Sports Medicine and Sports Science (S$4.75 million), Sports Education Programme (1) /Sports Partnership Promotion Programme (2) (S$3.98 million) and subsidies for facilities (S$2.73 million).

The SSC also announced a few new initiatives related to its funding policy.

##### **Matching Grant Scheme to Encourage Smaller NSAs to Tap on Sponsorship Market**

Under a pilot scheme, NSAs that receive an annual grant allocation of S$300,000 or less will be eligible for a matching grant. The matching grant is an incentive-based strategy to encourage NSAs to tap on commercial revenue, raise their own funds and be self-sustaining. The grant is applicable only to new commercial cash sponsorships that the NSA secures or an increased sponsorship quantum from an existing sponsor. Administered on a first-come-first-served basis (a total of $200,000 has been set aside for FY2008), the matching grant will be subjected to a maximum cap of S$20,000 per NSA per annum. This matching grant is over and above the FY2008 annual grant that the NSAs have received. Based on the funding allocation in FY2008, 38 NSAs qualify for this scheme.

##### **Reviewing of Secretariat Grants**

SSC will undertake a review of funding for NSAs' secretariats by studying best practices overseas and employing a Human Resource consultant to assess headcount needs and salary benchmarking for NSAs. This would include the possibility of providing shared secretariat services to similar NSAs and will commence in FY2009.

##### **NSAs to Draw On the Sports Education Programme**

NSAs can tap on the SSC's Sports Education Programme (SEP) as an additional means of funding. In order to do this, the NSA has to get its sports programme endorsed by the SEP panel. Once this is done the NSA can be a sports service provider and offer the programme to the schools. The applications for programme endorsement for SEP 2009 (1 January - 31 December 2009) are opened from 16 June to 31 July 2008.


**Footnote:**<br>
1) The SSC introduced the SEP in primary schools to junior colleges in April 2007 to encourage sports participation in schools and increase sporting opportunities for the young.
2) An initiative by the Singapore Sports Council aimed at generating more sporting opportunities through the support and assistance of partners' and service providers' events or programmes that are open for public participation.
