description: "Sport Singapore celebrates 50 years of sporting history this
  month, with the launch of a new book and the opening of a sport heritage
  exhibition, today. The new book, Sport in Singapore: Visions for Change, is
  the final edition of the book-trilogy and highlights the history of Singapore
  sport through the lens of former Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers who
  were instrumental in guiding and operationalising the vision of sport in
  Singapore. Complementing the book, the exhibition illustrates Singaporeâ€™s
  sporting journey and the transformation of local sport through preserved print
  magazine covers and publications collected over the years."
