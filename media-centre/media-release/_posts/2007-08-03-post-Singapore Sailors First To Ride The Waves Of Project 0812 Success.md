### **Singapore Sailors First To Ride The Waves Of Project 0812 Success**

**Singapore , 03 Aug 2007** - Team Singapore sailors today received a heart-warming gesture from PSB Academy at a well-wishing event held at Plaza Singapura. Titled "Bon Voyage! Team Singapore Sailors", this is the first of well-wishing activities for Project 0812 (P0812) athletes bound for the Olympics in 2008 or 2012. Jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council, the Singapore Sailing Federation and the PSB Academy, more than 50 students and teachers came to spur Team Singapore sailors to greater heights at Olympic glory. Among the athletes present today were 14 sailors from the Laser Men class, the Laser Radial class, the Laser Women class, the International 470 Men class and the International 470 Women class.

"We are heartened by the success of the 470 Men class sailors, who have qualified for the Olympics under P0812. We are confident that with strong support from the public and corporations like the PSB Academy, our top athletes will be inspired further in their quest for Olympic glory for Singapore." said Mr Ng Ser Miang, International Olympic Committee (IOC) Executive Board Member and Chairman of P0812 and the Guest-of-Honour for this event.

Mr Ng received the Olympic Sail Flag from the management of PSB Academy in the inaugural well wishing event for P0812 athletes. This was following PSB Academy?s Student Exchange programme to Qingdao, China from 20-27 May 2007 as part of the Olympic Regatta Volunteer Programme, where they were presented with the Olympic Sail Flag. The flag, symbolic of good Olympic spirit, will accompany the sailors going to Qingdao, China to participate in the "Good Luck Beijing ? 2007 Qingdao International Regatta" held from 9-24 August 2007. A banner from PSB Academy students and staff was also presented to the Team Singapore sailors in this symbolic event.

Commenting on the Olympic Regatta Volunteer Programme in Qingdao, China, Mr Henry Heng, CEO, PSB Academy said, "PSB Academy volunteers comprising Singaporeans and international students from Nigeria, India, Myanmar, Philippines, China, Indonesia and Malaysia, interacted and provided the Chinese communities and volunteers with valuable exposure to the world's cultural diversity. All these are part of PSB Academy's efforts to expand the learning experience of our students beyond the confines of the classroom. Through such experiences, we hope to inspire them to become savvy global citizens with natural curiosity to discover new learning."

From 3-5 August 2007, shoppers at Plaza Singapura can experience sailing on a sailboat simulator specially brought in to the mall. They can also participate in "how fast can you hoist the sail" challenge located at the mall?s atrium. The public is encouraged to show their support for Team Singapore athletes for the upcoming 24th SEA Games at the Team Singapore Exhibition found on levels five and six of Plaza Singapura.
