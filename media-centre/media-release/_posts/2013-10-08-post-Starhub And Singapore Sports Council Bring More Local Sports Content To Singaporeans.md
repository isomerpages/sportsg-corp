## **Starhub And Singapore Sports Council Bring More Local Sports Content To Singaporeans**

Singapore, 8 October 2013 - StarHub and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today to offer more local sports
content to a wider audience and enhance the sports viewership experience of Singaporeans. Held at Pasir Ris Sports and Recreation Centre, the signing ceremony also saw StarHub announce the launch of its free sports channel SuperSports Arena on 76.25MHz to almost all households in Singapore from 10 October 2013.

2. "StarHub is a local, home-grown company and we are proud of it. We have consistently supported the growth of sports in Singapore and see this MOU as a way to take our commitment to the next level. By combining SSC's expertise with our broadcasting reach, this partnership will make all sports available to all Singaporeans and energise the local sporting landscape," said Mr Tan Tong Hai, Chief Executive Officer, StarHub.

3. Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, SSC said, "We are seeing a growing demand for local sports content in Singapore. With the upcoming opening of the Sports Hub and the 2015 SEA Games in Singapore, we expect this demand to grow further. The MOU sets out our long term strategy to enhance the reach and quality of local sports content through media partners such as StarHub. With richer local content delivered across more platforms, we hope that more Singaporeans will watch, consume more sports and live better."

4. The MOU was signed by Mr Tan Tong Hai, Chief Executive Officer, StarHub and Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, SSC, and witnessed by Guest-of-Honour, Mr Lawrence Wong, Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information.

MOU reaffirms commitment to bring local sports to Singaporeans

5. The 3-year MOU will see an overall increase in local sports content on StarHub's broadcast platforms, with more National Sports Associations being featured in its programmes. StarHub will also dedicate a segment of its upcoming daily sports news show on SuperSports Arena to cover local sports events and profile local athletes.

6. StarHub and SSC will work together to progressively introduce new digital media initiatives, including the use of second screen technology for local sports events. This would enable sports fans to receive match analytics and view instant replays while watching the game.

Free sports for all: SuperSports Arena reaches almost all Singapore households on 76.25MHz

7. StarHub also announced the launch of the new revamped SuperSports Arena, which will now be available free of charge to almost all households in Singapore from 10 October 2013, including those without a StarHub TV set-top box. Previously available only on StarHub TV Channel 112 and 201, the channel will be fully decrypted, allowing any sports fan with an activated cable point to tune in to the channel at 76.25MHz.

8. SuperSports Arena is StarHub's in-house 24/7 dedicated sports channel. The channel's four content pillars are: local sports; international sports; sports-themed general entertainment; and active lifestyle content. The channel not only caters to sports fans, but also aims to introduce sports to traditionally non-sports viewers.

9. Unveiled with a brand new logo, the channel will adopt a multi-level approach to local sports coverage in Singapore, showcasing all levels of sport from grassroots all the way to international competitions. This ranges from coverage of the National School Games to the LionsXII, the S.League, the Singapore Slingers, the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore and the Singapore Open (badminton).

10. In addition, the channel will broaden viewers' sporting horizons by exposing them to a wide range of top notch international events such as the NBA basketball, the PGA Tour golf, ATP World Tour tennis, the FINA World Championships, the IAAF World Championships and German Bundesliga football.

11. SuperSports Arena aims to introduce sports and a sporting culture to non-sports viewers. Hence, sports-themed general entertainment content, like the drama series Hot Shot starring the Taiwanese superstar Show Luo as a high school basketball player and the popular football anime series Giant Killing, will be added to the channel's programming. This will be complemented by a slate of sports entertainment content such as WWE wrestling. This sports-themed general entertainment content will appeal to a new demographic of viewers and progressively introduce them to the idea of watching sports, eventually leading them to the channel's signature wide array of sports content.

12. Lastly, active lifestyle programmes such as healthyMEtv which advocate healthy living through exercise and proper nutrition will also be featured. By arming viewers with information on how to exercise, improve their diet and prevent the onset of lifestyle diseases, the content will inspire a new generation of Singaporeans to increase their participation in and support for sports

Launch of new daily sports news show SuperSports 360

13. The re-launch of SuperSports Arena also sees the debut of a new daily sports news show called SuperSports 360.

14. Presented by prominent local media personality Yasmin Abdol Hamid along with Kelly Latimer and Elliott Danker, the new half-hour daily sports news programme promises to present the best local and international sports coverage, aimed at delivering the day's most relevant sports updates and highlights important to viewers in Singapore. Besides having a dedicated local editorial team covering the latest in Singapore's sports scene, SuperSports 360 will feature sports action and highlights from around the world, including coverage of Singapore athletes competing overseas.
SuperSports 360 will air at 7pm every day on SuperSports Arena with a repeat at 11pm and the following day at 7am. The programme will premiere on 10 October 2013 with a 'live' interview with Ng Ser Miang, International Olympic Committee (IOC) Member and Singapore National Olympic Council's Vice President, on a range of topics such as the IOC Presidential Election and plans to develop an original sports event in Singapore with global appeal.
