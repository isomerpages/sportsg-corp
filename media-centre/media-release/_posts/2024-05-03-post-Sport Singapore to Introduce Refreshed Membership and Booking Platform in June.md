<p>MyActiveSG+ aims to provide members with a fairer &amp; more transparent

<p>Members to receive $10 ActiveSG Anniversary Credits upon logging in to
the platform</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 3 MAY 2024</strong> – Coming off ActiveSG’s 10th year
anniversary celebrations last month, Sport Singapore (“SportSG”) will be
introducing a refreshed web-based membership and booking platform, MyActiveSG+,
to its members from <strong><u>15 June</u></strong>.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the
years, SportSG has been taking in feedback regarding the current system
and incorporating changes where possible. Most recently it has incorporated
the security CAPTCHA on its Membership Management System (“MMS”) to prevent
scripting and other preventive measures like bot detection, in response
to feedback regarding scalpers gaming the system.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of its
continued efforts to ensure that members have easy and fair access to the
booking of public sport facilities and programmes, and to cater to members
changing habits and demands, SportSG will replace the current 10-year-old
MMS. MyActiveSG+ contains features developed from feedback and observations
from MMS users over the years, as well as from the recently piloted ActiveSG
Beta<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>,
which was introduced to members on a trial basis since 1 March 2024.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSG members
can look forward to the following updates on MyActiveSG+:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><u>A fairer and more transparent system for booking facilities</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Singpass app verification: </strong>Members are required to use
Singpass for sign up and login to MyActiveSG+. This feature:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>prevents people from holding multiple accounts for booking and balloting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>addresses the feedback from members having to compete for slots with people
who hold multiple accounts created using email address, or bots and scripters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peak hour<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a> facility ballot:</strong>&nbsp;
MyActiveSG+ will have a balloting feature for peak hour slots that remains
open for 24 hours, 14 days prior to date of play (D-14, closing at 11.59pm),
to allow everyone to have a fair chance of booking their preferred slot,
with ample time for consideration, and without having to worry about missing
a booking window.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Confirmation of slots.</u> After the ballot results are released the
next day, by 12pm, members with successful ballots will be given till 11.59pm
(on D-13) to pay to confirm their slots.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Unassigned slots from the peak-hour balloting exercise</u> will be released
for booking on a first-come-first-served basis at 12pm the next day (D-12)
i.e. 12 days before the date of use, along with all other slots (i.e. non-peak
hour slots).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of end-April, close to 30% of confirmed
bookings done through balloting on ActiveSG Beta were by members who did
not book a facility in the past year.</p>
<p><strong><u>User-centric features &nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Web-based platform:</strong> The web-based platform will keep users
up-to-date at all times and across devices. Users will no longer need to
install and regularly update an app on their mobile devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy-to-navigate user interface: </strong>MyActiveSG+ features
a more intuitive navigation, cleaner layout, and utilises a responsive
design that adapts seamlessly to different devices, whether mobile or web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamless linking of children through supplementary accounts: </strong>Parents
or legal guardians will soon be able to link their children (who are below
15 years old) to both their accounts through Singpass. In time to come,
ActiveSG will be introducing ‘family accounts’ on the new platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refunds and cancellations</strong>  <a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[3]</a><strong>: </strong>ActiveSG is developing a new “Refunds
and Cancellations” feature to be rolled out at a later stage in direct
response to public feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Sport Singapore
is committed to ensuring that ActiveSG members have access to public sport
facilities, and are able to do so with ease on a secure platform. We are
thankful for our members’ feedback over the years regarding our current
app, which we have taken on-board when we started planning for MyActiveSG+
in 2022. We are also grateful for our 2,000 members who came forward to
help us with the Beta version, including the balloting feature, and are
heartened by their positive feedback on its clean and easy-to-navigate
interface. Given this, we have decided to roll out MyActiveSG+ to members
in a progressive manner from June 2024. This is to ensure that we give
time for our members to familiarise themselves with the new app, and also
give ourselves room to make further adjustments based on usage patterns
and more feedback from our members as additional features are progressively
introduced,” said Alan Goh, CEO, Sport Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyActiveSG+
is developed in partnership with Open Government Products (“OGP”), and
supported by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (“GovTech”).
ActiveSG has been working with OGP and GovTech to build, test and improve
ActiveSG Beta. Since the start of development, the team has consulted,
considered feedback, and observed usage patterns of over 2,000 citizens.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRESSIVE TRANSITION TO MYACTIVESG+</strong>
</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since its introduction
in March, ActiveSG has steadily increased the number of facilities available
for booking on ActiveSG Beta so more members can onboard, try the new platform,
and provide feedback on an ongoing basis. The transition to MyActiveSG+
from 15 June will take on a similar progressive approach.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following
key implementation milestones are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>From 15 June</strong>: Members can start to login to MyActiveSG+.
As part of ActiveSG’s 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations, members
who login anytime between <u>15 June and 31 August</u> will receive a one-time
top up of $10 ActiveSG Anniversary Credits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>From 15 July</strong>: All facilities and programmes<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[4]</a> will be available
for booking on MyActiveSG+.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>From 15 August</strong>: Seasonal and day passes to swimming pools
and gyms are available for purchase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While all key features will be available on MyActiveSG+ by 15 August,
the current system will remain accessible till 1 October 2024.</p>
<p><strong>MIGRATION OF ACTIVESG CREDITS</strong>
</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Members’ ActiveSG Credits will be migrated in batches</strong> from
the existing system to MyActiveSG+ between 15 and 30 June. <u>During this period</u>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Users of the existing system may continue to pay for bookings and purchases
using credit/debit card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users of MyActiveSG+ may continue to pay for bookings and purchases using
credit/debit card and PayNow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The $10 ActiveSG Anniversary credits can also be used to offset bookings
on MyActiveSG+.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Members will be able to start using their ActiveSG Credits on MyActiveSG+
by 1 July. In addition, there will be an <u>automatic extension</u> of all
ActiveSG credits to 31 December 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DECOMMISSIONING OF ACTIVE WALLET – MYCASH</strong>
</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Active Wallet - MyCash will be decommissioned in mid-August</strong>.
Top-up from MyCash will cease on 15 May. From now till 14 August, ActiveSG
members with MyCash balance in their Active Wallet can continue to utilise
it as per normal. Any remaining MyCash funds will be refunded to users
via Paynow-NRIC-linked bank account by 31 August.</p>
