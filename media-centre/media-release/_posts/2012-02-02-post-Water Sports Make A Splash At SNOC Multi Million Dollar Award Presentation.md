Annex A - About The SNOC Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP)

In the 1990s, under the direction of then President Dr. Yeo Ning Hong, the Singapore National Olympic Council devised an incentive scheme to reward medal-winning athletes. The SNOC Multi-Million Dollar Awards Programme (MAP) provides a cash payout to athletes who win gold medals at the Olympic, Asian, Commonwealth and Southeast Asian (SEA) Games.

The largest award is $1 million, payable to athletes who achieve a gold medal standing at the Olympic Games. The smallest is award is $10,000, for athletes who win a gold medal at the SEA Games. The value of the awards varies with the respective Games, with the Olympic Games providing significantly higher payouts. The awards also vary based on individual versus team events and team sports.

There are ceilings on the awards. Athletes will be entitled to awards up to a maximum of three individual gold medals won at the SEA Games, up to two individual gold medals won at the Commonwealth and Asian Games, and the first gold medal won at the Olympic Games. All awards are presented to the winning athlete, not the national sports association, and are taxable.

The Tote Board/Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd is the primary sponsor of the SNOC MAP awards since 1993.

Athletes who break the South East Asian or Asian Games records will be awarded $5,000 and $50,000 respectively. This incentive does not apply to sports with no official records.

It is mandatory for all athletes to plough back 20% of the SNOC MAP awards to their National Sports Association for future training and development.
