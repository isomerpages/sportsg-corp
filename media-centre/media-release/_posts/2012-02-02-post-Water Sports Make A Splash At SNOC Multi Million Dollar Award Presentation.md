**Singapore, 2 February 2012** - For their great outing at the 26th SEA Games, 50 Team Singapore athletes from five water sports - canoeing, sailing swimming, waterpolo, and water ski - earned themselves a well-deserved S$335,000 or close to 65 percent of the total SNOC Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP) reward of S$525,000. They were joined by 28 others to receive their awards from Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC); and Mr Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development Youth and Sports.

2. "Thank you for giving your very best and for giving us so many reasons to cheer during the Games. Through your shining example, you continue to be a source of inspiration for others to embrace and excel in sport," said DPM Teo, who is also the Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs. "You have shown us what it means to be a Team Singapore athlete, displaying true grit, perseverance and commitment to your sport and most importantly, the Singapore Spirit."

3.

4. SEA Games debutant Arren Quek, who brought home the gold for Singapore for the first time in 18 years in the men's 50m freestyle event is dedicating his win to his parents by giving them all his SNOC MAP reward. He said, "My parents have been very encouraging and have supported me from the start. They made many sacrifices and have given a lot of their time to ferry me to and from training and attend my meets. This is just my way of saying thank you for all that they have done for me."

5.  Team Singapore paddlers with their five gold medal contribution received a total of S$65,000 for their efforts. The waterpolo players walked away with S$60,000 for having won the coveted gold medals in both the men's and women's team events.

6. Contract bridge player Tan Yoke Lan, who won Singapore's first ever SEA Games gold in the sport in the women's open pairs event with partner Seet Choon Cheng is giving 100% of her reward back to the Singapore Contract Bridge Association (SCBA). She said, "I want to donate my money to SCBA so that they can use it to help promote contract bridge among younger Singaporeans. I do hope that there will be more medals to come from the sport."

7. 413 Team Singapore athletes competed in the 26th SEA Games in Indonesia from 11 to 22 November 2011.

**Annex A - About The SNOC Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP)**

In the 1990s, under the direction of then President Dr. Yeo Ning Hong, the Singapore National Olympic Council devised an incentive scheme to reward medal-winning athletes. The SNOC Multi-Million Dollar Awards Programme (MAP) provides a cash payout to athletes who win gold medals at the Olympic, Asian, Commonwealth and Southeast Asian (SEA) Games.

The largest award is $1 million, payable to athletes who achieve a gold medal standing at the Olympic Games. The smallest is award is $10,000, for athletes who win a gold medal at the SEA Games. The value of the awards varies with the respective Games, with the Olympic Games providing significantly higher payouts. The awards also vary based on individual versus team events and team sports.

There are ceilings on the awards. Athletes will be entitled to awards up to a maximum of three individual gold medals won at the SEA Games, up to two individual gold medals won at the Commonwealth and Asian Games, and the first gold medal won at the Olympic Games. All awards are presented to the winning athlete, not the national sports association, and are taxable.

The Tote Board/Singapore Pools (Pte) Ltd is the primary sponsor of the SNOC MAP awards since 1993.

Athletes who break the South East Asian or Asian Games records will be awarded $5,000 and $50,000 respectively. This incentive does not apply to sports with no official records.

It is mandatory for all athletes to plough back 20% of the SNOC MAP awards to their National Sports Association for future training and development.
