This year, the adventure race, key highlight of Adventure Singapore saw close to 300 adventure racers compete in either the 50km Open route or the 30km Sprint route at iconic locations around the island. These routes took the participants through some of Singapore's unexplored adventure trails such as Lor Asrama and unprecedented team challenges, as they competed in a wide variety of adventure race disciplines, which includes kayaking, rock climbing and cycling.

Adventure racers in the Open category took part in the inaugural shooting challenge organised by the Singapore Shooting Association and Singapore Gun Club. A first for adventure racers in Singapore, participants got to fire a .22 pistol over 25 metres. Their appetite for adventure was furthered stroked with the first ever and swansong adventure challenge at the National Stadium. Emerging victorious at the end of the race was Adventure in Motion, which came in first in the Men's Open team category with a winning time of 4.29.06.

The public was treated to a series of spectacular stunts and activities at the fun-filled and exciting day-long adventure carnival at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza.
