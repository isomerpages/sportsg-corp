ActiveSG, Singapore’s national movement for sport and physical activity today announced a partnership to link the ActiveSG “Active Wallet” to NETSPay . The Active Wallet is presently used by ActiveSG members to book sports facilities, programmes or gain entry to its gyms and swimming pools across Singapore. With this collaboration, the 1.32 million ActiveSG members will be able to enjoy greater convenience and more incentives from ActiveSG partners who will come aboard to the push towards cashless transactions.  
  
“The Active Wallet is set to offer a wider range of opportunities to deepen our engagement with ActiveSG members, inspire sports participation and healthy living. As part of our Vision 2030 aspirations, ActiveSG is poised to enhance our Active Wallet offerings to better serve our people’s sporting needs and lifestyle essentials. We are excited about our partnership with NETS and the NETSPay,” said Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, Sport Singapore.  
  
Said NETS CEO, Mr Jeffrey Goh, “We are pleased to collaborate with ActiveSG to integrate NETSPay’s payment capabilities in the ActiveSG app and also work to enable acceptance of ActiveSG mobile app at NETS merchants.”  
  
The partnership with NETS will enable ActiveSG to enhance membership engagement through an improved ActiveSG app that will be released next month. The customisable app will allow members to specify their user preferences on the app front, and allow ActiveSG and its partners to support and encourage an active lifestyle through a myriad of incentive schemes.
