<p><strong>Singapore, 17 July 2024 – </strong>Sport Singapore (SportSG) takes
the findings of the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) seriously and is fully
committed to upholding good corporate governance and accountability in
ensuring prudent use of public funds.</p>
<p>AGO had covered areas related to revenue, procurement and payment, and
grants in its audit of SportSG, and its report had included observations
related to compliance with processes. There was no indication of internal
fraud or ill-intention. We have reviewed and tightened our processes to
address the observations highlighted in the AGO report for the financial
year 2023/2024.</p>
<p><strong><u>Tighter Controls Over Admissions to ActiveSG Pools and Gyms</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Through its data analysis and checks on ActiveSG pools and gyms admission
records, AGO observed that ActiveSG members had shared their special passes
with others for entry. There were also instances where members had abused
the ActiveSG pool/gym special or per-entry passes purchased at discounted
rates, and deceased members’ accounts were used for admissions.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that there could be tighter controls to prevent such abuse
and had made further enhancements to our ActiveSG membership system. Our
refreshed web-based membership and booking platform MyActiveSG+, which
has been progressively rolled out since 15 June 2024, will include safeguards
such as dynamic QR codes, the use of sgID, and SingPass Data Synchronisation
to prevent such instances.</p>
<p>As an added control measure, SportSG has put in place guides and checklists
to ensure that our staff are clear on the processes where manual checks
are required. SportSG will also educate the public on responsible use of
the ActiveSG membership and conduct periodic checks to ensure compliance
and detect unusual admission transactions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Enhanced Procedures for Revenue Contracting</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The AGO report highlighted observations related to the tender evaluation
process in two vending machine contracts checked. The scoring and other
factors considered should have been clearly presented to the tender approving
authority (TAA) for informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Since May this year, SportSG has enhanced our internal procedures for
revenue contracting and strengthened training for staff handling revenue
contracts to reinforce compliance with established policies and processes.</p>
<p><strong><u>Strengthened Procurement Processes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>AGO highlighted observations on two tenders for procurement of manpower
services and medical services. SportSG has reviewed them and established
that the awarded vendors had been evaluated fairly, there was no indication
of internal fraud or ill intention, and the safety of the public was&nbsp;not
compromised in any way.</p>
<p>SportSG acknowledges that there is scope for our procurement processes
to be strengthened. These include ensuring all scoring details are finalised
before tenders close, and timely approvals from TAAs are obtained before
communicating any information on tender awards. Staff will also be reminded
to plan and commence procurement of goods/services earlier to provide adequate
time for potential vendors to prepare for the goods/services required.</p>
<p>SportSG will apply these lessons learnt, as we continue to review and
strengthen our processes.</p>
