<h3><strong>Manulife Singapore commits some S$1 million to SwimSafer programme</strong></h3>
<p>Manulife Singapore becomes the first corporation to sponsor a national
water safety programme, as it commits some S$1 million to SwimSafer – an
ongoing initiative which imparts children with water safety knowledge and
water survival skills. SwimSafer is one of the many activities that come
under the umbrella of ActiveSG, a key element of the Vision 2030 sports
master plan.</p>
<p>2. As presenting sponsor for SwimSafer, Manulife Singapore will be working
closely with ActiveSG to promote the importance of water safety in the
community and in schools over the next three years. On top of its sponsorship
of S$900,000, the financial institution will provide additional funding
for outreach programmes. Mr Naveed Irshad, President &amp; Chief Executive
Officer of Manulife Singapore said, “Manulife has always been a big supporter
of sports, both locally and internationally. As a strong, trustworthy and
reliable financial services company; Manulife is here to help Singaporeans
fulfill their dreams, be it a child who is learning how to swim or our
clients, by giving them the financial security and peace of mind to do
what they most want to do. We believe that this collaboration will create
inroads to the sports industry, and by supporting a programme that is meaningful
and aligned with our values.”</p>
<p>3. True to its commitment, Manulife will be pumping in additional resources
to engage students on water safety in a more fun manner. This includes
producing special skits and souvenirs, to complement at least 40 outreach
programmes conducted by ActiveSG in its sports centres and to schools each
year. Over 170 primary schools that participate in SwimSafer annually will
stand to benefit from this effort.</p>
<p>4. Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chief Executive Officer, Sport Singapore said, “We
are excited to have Manulife on board in sharing our vision and journey
towards a safer sporting environment for all. Manulife’s involvement in
this national water safety programme is a testament of the company’s commitment
to the people of Singapore and to partnering us to enable all to Live Better
Through Sport.”</p>
<p>5. SwimSafer programme was first introduced in March 2010 as the only
national water safety programme. It replaced the Learn-To-Swim Programme
(LTSP) and the National Survival Swimming Award (NASSA). SwimSafer is carried
out at all 25 ActiveSG swimming complexes island-wide, and the programme
has certified over 80,000 students to date.</p>
