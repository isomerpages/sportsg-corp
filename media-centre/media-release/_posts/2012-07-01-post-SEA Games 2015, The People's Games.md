*28th SEA Games Steering Committee Kicks Off Inaugural Meeting*

**Singapore, 1 July 2012** - Taxi drivers, school children and youth, families, seniors, working adults, volunteers, corporate head honchos, volunteer welfare groups - these are just some of the groups the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games Steering Committee hopes to see participating actively and enjoying the 28th SEA Games to be held in Singapore in 2015.

2\. Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Mr Chan Chun Sing, who chairs the Games' Steering Committee said, "2015 is a special year. We are privileged to be hosting the SEA Games, the region's largest multi-sport extravaganza, on the 50th anniversary of Singapore's independence. SEA Games 2015 will allow us to extend our hand of friendship to our Southeast Asian neighbours."

3\. Comprising a diverse mix of people from the public, private and people sectors, the Steering Committee will provide guidance to the Executive Committee, chaired by SSC CEO Mr Lim Teck Yin, to attain the strategic objectives of the Games. The Steering Committee had a fruitful first meeting which set the tone for the 2015 Games to be relevant to all Singaporeans.

4\. "The 2015 Games are going to be an important piece of sporting history for Singapore - one that we will share as a nation and talk about for years with our children and grandchildren. Reaching out through the Steering Committee members, our community partners, corporate sponsors and volunteer networks, we are going to create a Games that will get people into the new National Stadium to cheer for a new generation of sporting heroes. The Kallang Roar is coming back to National Stadium for Singapore in 2015! " said Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, Singapore Sports Council.

5\. Mr Valerio Nannini, Managing Director, Nestle Singapore, said, "Sport possesses all the right ingredients to nourish the body, mind and soul. Nestle has been championing youth sports development in Singapore since the 1950s. SEA Games 2015 will provide companies an excellent platform to connect with Singapore and the region in a meaningful way."

6\. Added Dr Tan Eng Liang, Vice President, Singapore National Olympic Council, "Come 2015, a new group of sporting talents will represent Team Singapore and compete for honour and glory at the SEA Games on home ground. With a home court advantage, this is a perfect opportunity for Singaporeans to come out in force to support our athletes and cheer them on to victory."

7\. "NTUC Fairprice is happy to be a part of this national event. We will leverage on our large customer base and wide network of outlets to generate widespread interest in and ownership of the SEA Games," said Mr Tan Kian Chew, Group Chief Executive Officer, NTUC Fairprice.

8\. "The 28th SEA Games will provide a good opportunity for our youth to venture beyond the classroom and participate in meaningful activities that provide real life learning experiences. There are many ways to participate, such as volunteering as helpers, supporting our athletes at the Games and even cheerleading. We look forward to our youth stepping forward to get involved in SEA Games 2015," said Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister of State for Defence and Education.

9\. Anticipating the need for a large number of volunteers to support the Games, Mr Stanley Tan, Chairman of National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre, said, "We will be welcoming our friends from Southeast Asia to Singapore in 2015. Volunteers will be our frontline ambassadors and the face of Singapore during the Games. We will work with the organising committee to develop a good volunteers' programme so that volunteers will have a meaningful and positive experience."

10\. "Sport is a ready-made vehicle for companies to drive brand awareness and equity. The inclusion of several business-centric members in the Committee highlights the importance the Committee places on corporate support for the Games - through sponsorship, marketing, branding or corporate social responsibility initiatives," said Mr Leonard Tan, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, PurpleClick Media.

11\. "Having participated in every SEA Games since 1971 as a commentator, the previous three editions organised by Singapore have been most memorable for me in terms of our organisational excellence. I hope to draw upon my past experiences from the Games to ensure we leave no stones unturned in making the 2015 Games a tremendous success for everyone involved," said Mr Brian Richmond, a radio personality from Mediacorp.

12\. Returning to Singapore since it was last staged in 1993, the 28th SEA Games in 2015 will be the first large scale multi sport event to be held at the spanking new Singapore Sports Hub and multiple community sports venues across the island.
