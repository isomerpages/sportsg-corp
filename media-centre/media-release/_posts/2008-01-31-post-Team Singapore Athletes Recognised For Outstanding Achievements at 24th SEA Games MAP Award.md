I also urge the NSAs and the Sports School to work together with the Singapore Sports Council to schedule our young athletes for regular competitions at high quality meets so as to raise the standards of our young athletes and help them to qualify for the Youth Olympics. With our collective effort, winning our first Olympic Youth medal may not be just a dream," said Minister Teo.
