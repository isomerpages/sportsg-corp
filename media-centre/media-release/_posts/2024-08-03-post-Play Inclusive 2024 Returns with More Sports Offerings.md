<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 3 AUGUST 2024</strong> – Play Inclusive, Singapore’s
largest inclusive sport competition, returns for its seventh edition this
year, with an expanded variety of sports tailored to a broader range of
disability profiles. Held on 3 and 17 August 2024 at the Singapore Sports
Hub, the event fosters community inclusion by creating a platform where
friendships are forged and acceptance is cultivated through shared sporting
experiences.</p>
<p>The Play Inclusive competition added five new events this year, including
soundball, wheelchair rugby, relay run, football and basketball skills
challenges (See Annex A for the full list of sport offerings and its target
group). It is a culmination of a three-month training period for athletes
and their unified partners, featuring over 1,200 participants across two
days of competition.</p>
<p><strong><u>Play Inclusive 2024 Opening Day</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Play Inclusive 2024 was officially declared open by Guest-of-Honour Mr
Eric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Community
and Youth &amp; Ministry of Social and Family Development. This year is
the first time Play Inclusive is open to members of the public, to participate
in inclusive sports such as blind running, boccia, cycling, floorball,
football, para athletics, shooting and wheelchair rugby. There are also
basic health assessments for persons with disabilities, fringe activities,
as well as a concert featuring talented musicians of all abilities, such
as the inclusive orchestra Purple Symphony. Paralympian Nur Aini Yasli
will also be doing a short meet and greet at the concert.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr Marcus Tan, Chief of Sport Development Group, who oversees Sport Singapore’s
philanthropic arm SportCares, said, “Unified sport activities are great
platforms to create shared experiences, encourage greater sensitivity and
understanding of persons with disabilities. SportCares has been working
closely with Special Olympics Singapore and Singapore Disability Sports
Council (SDSC) to raise awareness and increase participation in disability
sports. With the strong support from our partners, corporates, and volunteers,
we are thrilled to expand our sport offerings this year to cater to a broader
range of disabilities, and also introduce inclusive sport tryouts to members
of the public for the first time.</p>
<p>"For example, we worked with SDSC to bring in frame runners at the para
athletics inclusive sports tryout to offer a unique experience for participants
and to build our para sport coaches’ capabilities in this growing sport.
We are heartened to see strong participation from Singaporeans at today’s
event and hope this will lead to a greater level of understanding and acceptance
of persons with disabilities.”</p>
<p>Dr Teo-Koh Sock Miang, President of Singapore Disability Sports Council,
Special Olympics Singapore and Singapore National Paralympic Council, said,
“Unified sports is Special Olympics' signature programme aimed at promoting
inclusion in sports for persons with disabilities and the broader community.
It serves to enhance interactions, foster empathy, respect, and deeper
appreciation among participants. We firmly believe that sports offer a
crucial platform for fostering unity within our community.</p>
<p>“This year, Play Inclusive has significantly broadened the scope of disability
sports competitions and showcase events. As the President of three disability
sport organisations in Singapore, I see Play Inclusive as integral to the
broader vision of the Disability Sports Master Plan in transforming the
lives of persons with disabilities (and unified partners) through sports
in Singapore.”</p>
<p><strong><u>Strong Support from Partners</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Over the years, Play Inclusive has seen strong support from various stakeholders
including schools, corporations, and sporting organisations. This year,
over 90 organisations including schools, adult disability organisations
and corporations are participating in the two-day event. This is more than
twice the number when the event was first launched in 2018, where there
were 38 pioneer partners on board.</p>
<p>Unified partner Spencer Ong (35 years old), a first-time Play Inclusive
volunteer from Citi Singapore participating in the goalball competition,
said, “I’ve participated in many corporate volunteering initiatives with
different communities, and this is one of the most impactful ones for me
personally. I remember the feeling when I put on a blindfold during the
first goalball training session, and suddenly all I could depend on was
my other senses. We relied on verbal cues to orientate ourselves and communicate
effectively, so that we can find the ball, pass to each other, and score.
I feel that this experience helps to foster interaction and promote greater
understanding of persons with disabilities, and I would definitely want
to be part of the Play Inclusive competition again.”</p>
<p>16 year old Teo Kai Jie from Rainbow Centre - Yishun Park School, who
was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at the age of six, said, “I
started playing football in 2022, and this is my third year taking part
in Play Inclusive football challenge. During the training sessions, we
do a lot of passing and shooting drills to improve our accuracy. At first,
I was a bit slow to react when receiving and passing the ball, but after
I learnt to better communicate with my teammates by calling out their names,
it improved. We all help and encourage one another in the process, and
the best part is when everyone comes together to celebrate after each little
win – like scoring a goal or managing to block the opponent from scoring.”</p>
<p>The second day of Play Inclusive 2024 will be held on 17 August. It will
be a full day of sports competitions for pre-registered participants, including
the athletes and unified partners, who will be competing in events such
as 3x3 basketball, floorball, soundball, as well as basketball and football
skills challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Play Inclusive 2024 is co-organised by SportCares, Special Olympics Singapore,
and Singapore Disability Sports Council, with the support of participating
schools from the Ministry of Education. It is one of the initiatives under
GetActive! Singapore 2024 to bring Singapore residents across all backgrounds
together to celebrate National Day through engagement in sports and ultimately
encourage Singaporeans to stay healthy and lead healthier lives. For more
