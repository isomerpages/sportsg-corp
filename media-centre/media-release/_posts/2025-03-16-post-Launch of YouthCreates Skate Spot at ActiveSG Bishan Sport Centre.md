<p><strong>Singapore, 16 March 2025</strong> – Singapore’s skateboarding community
welcomes the new YouthCreates Skate Spot @ ActiveSG Bishan Sport Centre,
ActiveSG’s first skate facility. The vibrant hub was mooted by YouthCreates
– an initiative under Sport Singapore (SportSG). The facility, which officially
opened today, serves as a dedicated space for the growing local skateboarding
community.</p>
<p>The launch featured a lively showcase of skateboarding competitions, demonstrations,
music and craft activities, drawing in about 200 skaters and spectators
of all ages. Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman, member of the Government Parliamentary
Committee (GPC) for Culture, Community and Youth, officiated the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The YouthCreates Skate Spot @ ActiveSG Bishan Sport Centre serves as a
pilot project for a community-centric skate facility. Unlike larger skateparks
at Somerset, East Coast Park, and Jurong Lake Gardens, this Skate Spot
offers a more accessible venue in the heartlands for young skaters, including
beginners, to develop their skills and build a community around the sport.</p>
<p>Mr Marcus Tan, Chief, Sport Development Group at SportSG, said, "The opening
of YouthCreates Skate Spot @ ActiveSG Bishan Sport Centre marks a significant
milestone in our efforts to make skateboarding more accessible to our community.
Beyond being just a skating facility, we envision this space evolving into
a vibrant community hub where experienced skaters can mentor beginners,
where local competitions can flourish, and where organic skating communities
can form in the heartlands. This is about creating opportunities for young
people to stay active while building meaningful connections through sport.".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skate sports have seen growing interest following its Olympic debut at
Tokyo 2020. In Singapore, there has been strong participation at YouthCreates
skating events such as Ramp-it-Up, Shredder Series, and MASS Singapore.</p>
<p>Hazmi Husaini, a skate coach, said, “It is great to finally have a skate
spot in Bishan. Having more dedicated skate spaces in the heartlands makes
a huge difference for the community, especially for younger skaters looking
for a place to practise and connect with others. We are excited to see
the skateboarding scene grow even more with facilities like this.”</p>
<p>The YouthCreates Skate Spot opens from 7am to 10pm daily, in line with
ActiveSG Bishan Sport Centre’s operating hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement, SportSG has signed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) with the National Youth Council (NYC) to introduce the Young ChangeMakers
– YouthCreates (Sport) Grant. This initiative aims to empower young people
to kickstart community-driven projects through sport, reinforcing SportSG’s
commitment to fostering active and engaged communities.</p>
<p>The launch of the Young ChangeMakers – YouthCreates (Sport) Grant marks
a significant step in supporting youth-led sporting initiatives. Through
the collaboration between YouthCreates and NYC, the Young ChangeMakers
grant cap has been increased from $5,000 to either $6,000 or $8,000, based
on project merit. This enhancement ensures Singapore’s youth have access
to adequate funding and resources to organise sport-related initiatives
that they are passionate about.</p>
<p>Ms Karen Lee, Director of Partnership Lab at NYC, added: “We recognise
that youths would like to contribute back to their community in different
ways, and sports is one key area. The partnership through the Young Changemakers
– YouthCreates (Sport) will expand the opportunities for youths to give
back to the community, through something close to their hearts – sports.”</p>
<p>Youths interested in applying for the grant can submit their proposals
via the <strong><a href="https://oursggrants.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>OurSG Grants Portal</u></a></strong>,
starting today.</p>
