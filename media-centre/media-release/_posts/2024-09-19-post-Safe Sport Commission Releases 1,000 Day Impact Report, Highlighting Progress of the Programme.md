<p><strong>Singapore, 19 September 2024 </strong>– The Safe Sport Programme,
a harmonised framework for safeguarding sport in Singapore, recently marked
its 1,000th day. To commemorate this milestone, the Safe Sport Commission
released an impact report to highlight the significant strides made to
foster a positive sporting environment in the areas of policymaking, training
and education and case management - the three central pillars of the Safe
Sport framework.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Policymaking</u>
</p>
<p>Launched in November 2021, the Safe Sport Programme sets a comprehensive
standard for safeguarding practices across the sporting community that
has been widely embraced by athletes, parents, coaches, instructors, and
sports administrators. To date, 60 sporting organisations have signed onto
the national framework. Member organisations have incorporated the Safe
Sport Unified Code into their organisational policies and governance documentations,
as well as put in place mechanisms for reporting and responding to concerns.
As a key signatory to the Safe Sport Programme, Sport Singapore (SportSG)
has taken the lead to protect the well-being of its participants, which
has impacted close to 150,000 persons under its initiatives, including
ActiveSG facility users and Learn-to-Play programme participants, children
and youths participants in the ActiveSG Academies and Clubs, Team Nila
volunteers, Team Singapore athletes supported by the Singapore Sport Institute
(SSI), and coaches registered with the National Registry of Coaches (NROC).</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Training and Education</u>
</p>
<p>In the aspect of training and education, the Safe Sport Commission has
been actively engaging the sporting community to nurture a culture of awareness
and accountability across the sport organisations. As of 19 August 2024,
the team has conducted 292 man-hours of workshops and outreach, trained
431 safeguarding officers across 138 organisations, and achieved a completion
of 9,247 training modules. Through collaborations with the Singapore Institute
of Architects and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), the Safe Sport
Commission also continues to explore other aspects of safe sport, for example,
how the design of the physical environment contributes to incidents of
abuse and harassment, as well as understanding bystander behaviours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Case Management</u>
</p>
<p>The streamlined case management service has been a crucial part of the
Safe Sport Programme as it allows for independent investigation of reports
of concern, which gives assurance to affected parties<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and
respondents<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a> that
reports will be managed fairly. It also relieves member organisations of
the administrative burden of investigating serious cases and ensuring appropriately
trained personnel are involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the first 1,000 days, the Safe Sport Commission received 274 reports
of concern, of which 126 reports were assessed to be related to misconduct
under the Safe Sport Unified Code. The most number of reported cases were
relating to physical and psychological misconduct, which comprise slightly
over half (56%) of the total cases. Athletes (32%) represented the largest
group of affected parties, while coaches (48%) represented the largest
group of respondents. Majority of the misconduct cases (62%) were classified
as low severity, while 21% and 17% were classified as moderate and severe
cases respectively<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moderate and severe cases were referred to the Safe Sport Disciplinary
Panel, where the Panel will ascertain the seriousness of the misconduct
based on the degree of culpability and harm caused, and consider the aggravating
and mitigating factors before coming to a decision on the appropriate measures
or sections. Since it was first appointed in August 2022, the Safe Sport
Disciplinary Panel, has convened nine hearings<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a> to date, and issued sanctions ranging from
suspensions to permanent ineligibility. The outcomes of the hearings are
listed in a <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/case-management/disciplinarydatabase/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">disciplinary database</a>.
Apart from participating in hearings, the panel members also engaged in
communities of practice<a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a> with the Safe Sport Support Network and
underwent training on trauma-informed approaches in the disciplinary process.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>New Appointments in the Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 1 August 2024, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)
has appointed the Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel members for its second
term. The Panel, who will be serving for a three-year term, comprises eight
legal practitioners and 12 members of the sporting community. The newly
appointed members include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Ms Kuah Boon Theng</strong>, Senior Counsel, who is appointed
the Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel Chair. She replaces Ms Molly Lim Kheng
Yen, Senior Counsel, who has elected to step down. Ms Lim was instrumental
in the first term, where she helped to set up the processes for investigation
and hearing of cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Former national athletes <strong>Ms Joscelin Yeo </strong>(swimming)<strong>, </strong>who
is also a Singapore Sport Hall of Famer, and <strong>Ms Quek Soo Teng </strong>(volleyball),
who have been appointed as Ordinary Members.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ms Chan Yen San, Chairperson of the Safe Sport Commission</strong>,
said, “I’m immensely proud of the progress we’ve made with our member organisations
in the first 1,000 days of the Safe Sport Programme in fostering a safer,
and more inclusive sporting community. This milestone wouldn’t have been
possible without the independent adjudication provided by the Disciplinary
Panel under the leadership of Ms Molly Lim. As we look ahead, I have full
confidence in the appointment of Ms Kuah Boon Theng as the incoming Chair
of the Disciplinary Panel. Her legal expertise in healthcare and ethics,
combined with her experience in dispute resolution, will ensure that the
highest standards of integrity and fairness in the disciplinary portion
of the Programme are upheld.”</p>
