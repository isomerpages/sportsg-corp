### **WaterFest by the Bay 2007: Bringing You Closer to the Waters**

This year's WaterFest Singapore kicks off with exhilarating water sports competitions for the first time at the Marina Bay Floating Platform on Saturday and Sunday, 25 and 26 August. For the first time, a professional competitive element is included in this year's WaterFest by the Bay, promising an event that will get your adrenalin pumping with high-speed action.

The Wakeboard &amp; Waterskate Rail Jam will create a big splash as competitors flaunt their stunts on two man-made pools on the floating platform, allowing spectators to experience high-flying wakeboard action right before their eyes. The set-up will feature a mechanical winch to tow the riders, two inflatable pools filled with water, and rails and ramps in the pools for the riders to negotiate and perform various manoeuvres.

"The Wakeboard &amp; Waterskate Rail Jam gives the public the opportunity to be exposed to this popular sport as they are just meters away from the action. They will be able to immerse themselves in the heat of the action as riders perform moves on the various obstacles, some of which are likely to have a high degree of difficulty," said Mr. Paul Fong, General Manager of the Singapore Waterski and Wakeboard Federation.

Another competitive event that is on display is the Jetsports SuperCourse Team Relay Challenge. The high-speed, fast track personal water craft endurance race will make its debut as the region's first. The fast sweeping technical turns allows the powerful watercraft to crank out speeds in excess of 120 Km per hour. The track is approximately 1.7 km in length for one lap with an average race time of 45 minutes. This highly defined course pays emphasis on speed and team strategy, giving riders more options to overtake during the race.

When asked about his thoughts on being part of WaterFest by the Bay, Mr. Justin Lee, President of the Singapore Powerboat Association (SPBA) said, "We would like to add a little motor racing element on the water this year. The inaugural SuperCourse has all the indications of becoming a regional event with riders from across Asia taking part, and to watch Daytona-type racing on water within close proximity from the floating platform - it will be something different and definitely exhilarating!"

The Marina Bay area will also echo with the sound of drumbeats, as dragon boats splice through the waters. Spectators will witness an intense race mixed with strength and dexterity as corporations battle it out in this year's WaterFest Dragon Boat Race.

As part of this year's National Day Celebrations, WaterFest by the Bay is a carnival on water with a myriad of activities happening throughout the two-day event.

Spectators can witness the renowned Stars of China performing in Singapore for the first time. The team from China will showcase their array of skills through the endless variety of water skiing acrobatics. Having already performed in over 300 ski shows, the Stars of China recently won the Team Champion title in the Sino-American Water Ski Show 2007. This will be the first time they are performing outside China.

Those not afraid to get wet can take part in Splash Battle Zone. Making its debut in Singapore, players will be equipped with Super Soakers and they will be tasked to overcome obstacles, shoot their opponents and targets to win the game! This battle is open to the public with a registration booth centrally located on-site at the Marina Bay floating platform. The winning team will take home the grand prize of S$1,000 cash.

Another competition that will be open to the public is the land-based machine rowing competition. Those who feel they have guts and stamina to take part in this competition may stand a chance to win cash prizes. Spectators can register at on-site booths on the Marina Bay floating platform.

Carnival goers can also try out free activities such as scenic boat rides, banana boat rides and jet-ski try-outs.

The public can also sign up for a photography competition and a children's art contest during the two-day event, with attractive cash prizes up for grabs!

For those who wish to remain dry, there is a kid's carnival zone, exciting stage games, F&amp;B stalls and dog shows by renowned dog trainer - Patrick Wong, to ensure that there is an activity for everyone.

"Singapore has the perfect climate and the perfect location to enjoy the different aspects of a waterfront sporting lifestyle," said Mr. Yazed Osman, Event Director of WaterFest Singapore 2007. "We want to take this opportunity to encourage Singaporeans to appreciate and enjoy our water resources all over the island through participating in the wide variety of water sports and water-related recreational activities that we have planned for WaterFest."

WaterFest by the Bay will give the public a glimpse of the thrills and spill at the fun-filled activities they can look forward to throughout the rest of WaterFest Singapore, which will last six weeks till 7 October 2007.
