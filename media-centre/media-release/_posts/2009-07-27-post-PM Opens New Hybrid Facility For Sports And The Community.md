### **PM Opens New Hybrid Facility For Sports And The Community**

_Sengkang SRC Offers Sports and Recreation Centre and a Community Club, All Under One Roof_

**Singapore, 26 July 2009** - Joined by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and grassroot leaders, residents from the Sengkang West Constituency gathered this morning to celebrate the official opening of their new 40,282m playground, Sengkang Sports and Recreation Centre (SRC). The first in a new generation of hybrid sports facilities that is co-located with a Community Club, the SRC stands head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to the services and facilities it can offer.

2. The Sengkang SRC boasts an impressive assortment of facilities, such as four swimming pools, of which two are of Olympic-sized, assortment of water slides; an indoor sports hall; a gymnasium; a dance studio; as well as a variety of retail and food outlets. In addition, due to its co-location with the Anchorvale Community Club, it facilitates the organisation of a much greater variety of sports, recreation and community activities-seamlessly catering to the diverse needs and wants of the community-all at one convenient location.

3. "The motivation behind such a unique concept ultimately boils down to our desire to bring the community together through sports and other recreational activities," said Mr Alex Chan, Chairman of the Singapore Sports Council (SSC). "With the co-location of the Sengkang SRC and Anchorvale Community Club, residents will be able to enjoy both facilities under one roof."

4. Another attraction of the spanking-new facility is its two state-of-the-art hockey pitches, which was the official venue for the Standard Chartered Bank FIH Men's Junior World Cup 2009 in June 2009.

5. The development of such hybrid facilities is part of the SSC's continual efforts to develop local sports, such as hockey. With the success of the recent Junior World Cup, the Sengkang SRC has become the 'in' place for hockey in Singapore, and will serve to raise the standard of the sport within the local community. On the international front, there are plans to ultilise the SRC as a venue for the upcoming Youth Olympic Games Singapore 2010.

6. On top of everything, the Sengkang SRC, together with the Anchorvale Community Club, was recently awarded Gold for the much coveted 'Universal Design Award for the Built Environment' from the Building and Construction Authority for addressing the needs of all age groups and people with different abilities. Features such as full accessibility to wheelchair users at the swimming pool, gym, sports hall and other activity rooms, played an instrumental role in helping it clinch the award.

7. "The SSC has always been seeking new ways to integrate the fun element into sports to get people started on a life-long affair with sports, with a healthy lifestyle in mind. Developing top notch sports facilities like the one here allows residents to try out various sports, find something that they enjoy and hopefully even excel in that discipline. This will, in turn, lead to the birth of the next generation of Singapore athletes and sports enthusiasts," concluded Mr Chan.
