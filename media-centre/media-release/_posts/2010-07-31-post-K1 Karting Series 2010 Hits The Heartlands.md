### **K1 Karting Series 2010 Hits The Heartlands**

_Organisers Bring High Octane Action To Over 10,000 People As Singapore Gears Up For The 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX_

**Singapore, 31 July 2010** - The K1 Karting Series (K1) promises to bring onboard new exciting programmes to the heartlands from today to 12 September 2010, providing entertainment and exhilaration to various corners of Singapore, in the lead-up to the 2010 FORMULA 1 SINGTEL SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX.

2. Through the inception of K1 in 2007, Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has lent its support to the series, which reached out to close to 20 locations across Singapore and to more than 100,000 residents. This year, apart from the general public, K1 aims to reach out to school students through dedicated karting hours for the latter, beginning with its first pit-stop today at the Jalan Besar Sports Fest.

3. Students, alongside 18 and 36 junior participants from private sports clubs and Asian Women's Welfare Association (AWWA) EXCELerate Services respectively, were invited to join the first go-karting session from 9am to 12pm, while the second session was opened to the public from 1pm to 5pm. The Sports Fest was hosted by the Kallang Community Club as part of the celebration for the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, and witnessed a healthy turnout comprising youths and their family members. The event was graced by Dr Lee Boon Yang, Member of Parliament for Jalan Besar GRC and Adviser for Jalan Besar GROs.

4. "To grow a strong motorsports culture in Singapore, we need to bring the sport to the people. The K1 Karting Series does that in bringing go-karting to the community and thereby allowing the community at large to participate and feel the dynamics of racing. Events like K1 also help people to appreciate motorsports related events, such as the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix and gear up our people for other racing events in the upcoming Changi Motorsports Hub in 2012," said Mr Fan Chian Jen, Director, Facilities and F1 Team, SSC.

5. On top of K1, participants were also treated to a slew of activities such as archery, Fuzion Ball, street soccer, drumming and wine appreciation workshops, balloon sculpting and face painting. Go-karting participants dressed in their favourite Formula 1 attire (t-shirt, cap, etc) also received Let's Play souvenirs.

6. Star cadet karters from local racing outfit Drakar Racing also donned their red and black team colours at the event. Drakar's star cadet karters Jon Lee, Glenn Chiam, Jordan Tay and star junior karter Amin Noorzilan have been on the podium for every round of the Singapore National Karting Championship to-date. Along with the rest of the team like senior karters Mohammad Nasri Naufal and Sean Hudspeth, karters from Drakar Racing shared their experiences with the community and how motorsports is fun and beneficial for youth development.

7. The organising committee is currently finalising the details of the remaining three pit-stops and will release information as soon as they are confirmed. Activities in the pipeline include a go-karting challenge, dance party, two-day carnival and the first K1 night go-karting session.
