### **SG Changi Wins Bid For Changi Motorsports Hub**

**Singapore, 26 March 2010** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today that it has selected the consortium known as SG Changi Private Limited (SG Changi) to design, build, finance and manage the Changi Motorsports Hub (CMH). SG Changi will invest S$330 million to develop the Changi Motorsports Hub - which will be Asia's premier motorsports and entertainment centre.

2. Making the announcement at a Press Conference today, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, said, "This exciting new project will be a great boost for motorsports in Singapore by providing a permanent base to groom motorsports talent, promote industry development, host new international events and provide more entertainment and lifestyle options for Singaporeans and tourists. We have chosen the consortium with the best combination of an optimised track design, top notch facilities, exciting programming and financial viability."

3. The winning bid's track design and racing facility elements had a good mix of flexibility and functionality. In addition, it included 'Green Initiatives', where Environmentally Sustainable Design (ESD) features are included in the various aspects of the CMH development, including the possible installation of solar panels on the roof of the main grandstand.

4. SG Changi also showed that they understood Singapore's key requirement for 'Centre of Excellence for Motorsports training and education' at the Changi Motorsports Hub. Their bid comprises reputable motorsports training provider E-Rain Racing Academy from Korea, and a well-connected sponsorship and marketing company Norman, who has the ability to bring in other renowned racing academies from Europe along with their training programmes to the Hub. In developing a sustainable ecosystem, SG Changi offered the most practical and achievable commercial mix with a business model that has potential to attract racing and non-racing patrons all year round.

5. The CMH is expected to feature top-notch motorsports facilities and amenities for motorsports enthusiasts, businesses, consumers and tourists, sitting on a 41-hectare sea-facing site near Changi Airport. Three consortia submitted their bids on 27 August 2009 and all three showed different approaches to develop CMH as one of Asia's first premier motorsports and entertainment centre.

6. "The Singapore Sports Council has been working closely with the Singapore Motorsports Association and other government agencies to develop a comprehensive motorsports development plan. The Changi Motorsports Hub will accelerate our plans and will keep us in the forefront in the Asia's motorsports circle," said Mr Alex Chan, Chairman, Singapore Sports Council.

7. With the selection of SG Changi, the Changi Motorsports Hub is expected to be operationally-ready by the end of 2011 and ready for the 2012 racing season. It will feature a permanent racetrack of 3.7 kilometres, along the Changi coastline, complemented with a permanent sheltered grandstand for 20,000 spectators. The design of the racetrack will also strive to maximize spectator viewing experience.

8. SG Changi is expected to release more details and the construction timeline at a later date.
