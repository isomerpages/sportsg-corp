With the 2017 **BNP Paribas WTA Finals Singapore Presented by SC Global** less than a month away, Singapore is set to come alive in October with a series of tennis and lifestyle-related activities lined up for both sports and non-sports fans.

In conjunction with the WTA Finals, Sport Singapore will be launching today the inaugural **Singapore Tennis Festival** – a month-long event for Singaporeans to experience and find out more about the sport. The festival will offer various opportunities to participate in tennis-themed carnivals, competitions, clinics, try-outs and meet like-minded friends.

There are more than 35 events taking place during the festival, many of which are organised by corporate and community partners.

Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO, Sport Singapore, said, “The Singapore Tennis Festival comes on the back of the successful Singapore Football Week where we saw many people coming together to play football  then afterwards head to the Sports Hub to watch the International Champions Cup.”

“Like the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix and 2017 International Champions Cup Singapore, the WTA Finals offers the chance for people to experience and be inspired by world-class sporting action. Through the Singapore Tennis Festival, we want to acquaint more people with Tennis so they are able to better appreciate the tennis action on show during the WTA Finals and build an affinity with the sport,” Mr Lim added.

##### **Learn, Play and Appreciate Tennis at the Singapore Tennis Festival Experience Tour**

As part of the festival, there will also be a **Singapore Tennis Festival Experience Tour** taking place at the Sports Hub from 22-29 October.

Designed to offer an all-encompassing Tennis experience, participants will not only be able to watch the athletes in action during the WTA Finals but also get the chance to take part in fun activities such as Virtual Tennis, and play tennis with our Team Singapore athletes.

For those without experience in tennis, the tour can also be tailored to introduce participants to the sport and teach them the basics of playing the sport.

Mr Lai Chin Kwang, Chief, ActiveSG said, “There is no better way to find out why Tennis is one of the most popular sports around than to pick up a racquet and experience it first-hand. The Singapore Tennis Festival Experience Tour will give participants the chance to enjoy Tennis and hopefully inspire them to see the sport as one which they will love to play and watch regularly.”
