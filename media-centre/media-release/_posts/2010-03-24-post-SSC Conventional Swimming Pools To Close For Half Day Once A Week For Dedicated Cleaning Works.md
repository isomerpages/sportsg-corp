### **SSC Conventional Swimming Pools To Close For Half-Day Once A Week For Dedicated Cleaning Works**

**Singapore, 24 March 2010** - Starting from 5 April 2010, all of the Singapore Sports Council's (SSC) 20 conventional swimming pools will be closed for a half-day once a week to enable for dedicated and comprehensive upkeep and maintenance works such as horticulture work, de-rusting and painting while minimising inconvenience to pool visitors.

2. The operating hours of the SSC conventional pools on their designated days of closure will be 2.30 pm to 9.30 pm. However, all the swimming pools will remain open on public holidays, even if they fall on the designated pool closure days. A schedule of the pool closures can be found in Annex A.

3. "The SSC is dedicated to providing safe and clean facilities for the public. Hence, closing our swimming pools for a half-day once a week would greatly facilitate our cleaning and maintenance operations, thus allowing us to further enhance the ambience and cleanliness of our pools for the enjoyment by the public," said Mr Kenneth Hui, Chief, Sports Facilities Group, Singapore Sports Council.

4. To further minimise inconvenience to the public, the schedule of the pool closures is done in a way such that there will at least be one nearby alternative swimming pool within the same zone that the public can visit, should the pool that they wish to visit is closed.
