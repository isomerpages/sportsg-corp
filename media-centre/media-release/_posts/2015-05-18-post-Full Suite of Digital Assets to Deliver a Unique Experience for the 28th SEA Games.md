### **Full Suite of Digital Assets to Deliver a Unique Experience for the 28th SEA Games**

The 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games has unveiled several different digital platforms for the Games which promises to offer the most comprehensive digital experience for all fans no matter where they are, be it at home, on the move or at the games venues itself. This is part of the overall strategy to celebrate action and bringing people together through the Games, regardless whether they are in or outside Singapore, The Digital platforms will allow the organisers to go beyond venue capacity and geographical boundaries and to reach out to the entire region.

“Making the games accessible to as many people as possible has always been a priority for SINGSOC. Tremendous effort has gone into making sure that the 28th SEA Games in Singapore can achieve this by charting new grounds to deliver and enhance fan experiences through its digital offerings. I am very excited to see how the public will react to being able to watch and interact with the SEA Games in an entirely new and immersive way through digital devices,” said Mr Lim Teck Yin, EXCO Chairman, Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC). “The growth in our social fanbase and digital traffic has been very encouraging. We want to keep them updated and excited about the Games, no matter where they live".

The 28th SEA Games TV mobile application, a first in SEA Games history, can be accessed from any smart mobile device or tablet for iOS and Android. This second screen app is a new addition to the SEA Games’ digital arsenal and will be the first interactive multi-camera coverage app developed for any multi-sport competition. The multi-camera experience will utilise up to 16 cameras to showcase eight sports and offer the most immersive viewing experience. SEA Games TV will be available for free public download from 25 May and promises to really bring the experience both at the venue and away from it to a whole new level.

Harbans J Singh, 2IC of Digital, SINGSOC was delighted that SINGSOC’s digital aspirations are all ready to bear fruits. “From conceptualistion to where we have arrived today, the journey has been an extraordinary one in making this Games the most digitally innovative in SEA Games history. In the last three years over 500 people have been engaged and involved in developing and fine tuning all the different aspects of this remarkable digital experience. We are thankful to all our sponsors and vendors who were in this journey to make this happen. Now, it is for our people in Singapore and our neighboring Southeast Asia to experience and celebrate the extraordinary with us through these easily available 28th SEA Games digital assets.”

The official SEA Games website will feature an all new 28th SEA Games Social Wall where bite-sized content, photos and videos created primarily by volunteer reporters from Team NILA will be showcased. With over 100 volunteers covering the events across all 31 venues, everyone will be able to experience the games in an up close and personal manner through the eyes of everyday Singaporeans. Tagged according to sports, countries and venues, users can conveniently search and customise the content they consume.

The SEA Games will be streamed live via the official SEA Games YouTube channel, showcasing 17 different sports as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 600 hours of sports competition will be streamed live. Post event highlights and highlights of daily golden moments will also be available on the YouTube channel for those that may have missed the live event.

Social interaction is a key part of the 28th SEA Games with the NILA’s Quest digital game.
