<p><strong>Singapore, 2 April 2024</strong> – The Sport Excellence Scholarship
(<em>spex</em>Scholarship) and the new Sport Excellence Potential (<em>spex</em>Potential)
programmes offered by Sport Singapore (SportSG) provide an enhanced level
of support for athletes within Singapore’s High Performance Sports (HPS)
system. Today, the <em>spex</em>Scholarship programme adds 103 new <em>spex</em>Scholars
<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup> 
</a>across 26 sports. Additionally, the new <em>spex</em>Potential programme
inducts its inaugural batch of 48 athletes across 22 sports.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em><u>spex</u></em><u>Scholarship – a key pillar of Singapore’s HPS system</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The <em>spex</em>Scholarship has been a key pillar of Singapore’s HPS system,
offering financial and programmatic support for athletes within our HPS
system since its inception in 2013.</p>
<p>Its comprehensive suite of support includes a monthly stipend; support
for local and overseas training and competitions; sports equipment; access
to a sports science team in areas such as such as biomechanics, physiology,
physiotherapy, strength and conditioning, and sports nutrition; a curated
coaching programme which helps athletes with diet, sleep, recovery and
preparation and other aspects required to get them competing at peak condition.</p>
<p>Over the years, it has grown our base of sporting talent while enabling
more athletes to achieve breakthrough successes at the elite level.</p>
<p>For instance, national sprint queen Shanti Pereira, who returned to the
programme in 2022 has seen steady improvement in her performances — going
from podium finishes at the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games-level to breaking
records and topping the podium at the Asian Championships and Asian Games.
National para swimmer Toh Wei Soong who joined the programme in 2018 has
also grown into a key medal hopeful at the Asian level and beyond, most
recently bagging four medals at the Asian Para Games last year en route
to becoming Team Singapore’s most bemedalled athlete at the continental
showpiece.</p>
<p><em>Spex</em>Scholars comprised just 10% of Team Singapore's contingent
at the 2023 SEA Games but contributed 52% of our medal tally. Similarly,
they comprised 14% of our contingent at the 2022 Asian Games but contributed
62% of our medal tally.&nbsp; At the ASEAN Para Games 2023, <em>spex</em>Scholars
made up 28% of the contingent but contributed to 41% of our medals while
they made up 23% of our 2022 Asian Para Games contingent and clinched 63%
of our medals.</p>
<p>To help more athletes achieve their potential, we have 103 <em>spex</em>Scholars
across 26 sports in the programme this year, marking a steady increase
since the inaugural batch of 61 <em>spex</em>Scholars in 2013.</p>
<p><strong><u>Inaugural batch of </u><em><u>spex</u></em><u>Potential athletes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>First announced in August 2023, the <em>spex</em>Potential programme aims
to strengthen the support during youth-to-senior athlete transition and
develop promising athletes to achieve sustainable high-performance outcomes.
It bridges the gap in our athletes’ journey towards the <em>spex</em>Scholarship
by preparing them for sporting excellence at SEA Games level, so that more
can aspire to higher levels of sport excellence beyond that – at Asian
and World levels.</p>
<p>By identifying young athletes with strong potential to succeed at the
SEA Games level and beyond, we can grow our base of high-performance athletes
and support them earlier in their journey.</p>
<p><em>Spex</em>Potential athletes will also receive support to prepare them
for sporting excellence at the Major Games, including financial and programmatic
support. They will receive a monthly stipend, as well as financial support
to cover the costs of coaching, training and competition, as well as equipment.
These are on top of education, career and personal development support.</p>
<p>The programme, which aims to prepare athletes for gold medal success at
the SEA Games level and beyond, welcomed its inaugural cohort of 48 athletes
across 22 sports today.</p>
<p><strong><u>Holistic Support for National Athletes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond <em>spex</em>Scholarship and <em>spex</em>Potential, SportSG also
provides our athletes with a comprehensive suite of support. Apart from
supporting their training needs, SportSG facilitates their sporting journey
throughout their education and employment through various <em>spex</em> initiatives
such as <em>spex</em>Business, <em>spex</em>Education, <em>spex</em>GLOW (Grant
for Loss of Wages) and <em>spex</em>TAG (Training Assistant Grant).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Alan Goh, Chief Executive Officer of SportSG, said, “Singapore’s High
Performance Sports (HPS) system nurtures our local athletes at different
stages of their development pathways, with the aim of helping them to realise
their fullest potential and represent Team Singapore. This new <em>spex</em>Potential
programme provides our young, budding athletes with both the support to
kickstart their careers and the opportunities to succeed in their journey.”</p>
<p>He added, “The programme will also help to establish better youth-to-senior
athlete transitions, develop successors to our older Team Singapore athletes
when they retire, and allow our sporting successes to be sustainable. SportSG
will continue to partner our National Sport Associations (NSAs) in athlete
pathways development, and we look forward to having more high performing
athletes join the <em>spex</em>Potential programme in the coming years.
Congratulations to our very first batch of <em>spex</em>Potential athletes!”</p>
<p>Mr Kon Yin Tong, Chairman of the <em>spex</em>Scholarship Selection Committee
and Chairman of SportSG, said, “My heartfelt congratulations to all the
recipients. There are a couple of major competitions this year, including
the Paris Olympics and Paralympics. We trust that the holistic and personalised
support provided under the <em>spex</em>Scholarship, which takes care of
their training needs, will give the athletes a boost in their preparations
for these competitions. As we begin a new milestone with the introduction
of <em>spex</em>Potential this year, we hope that more promising talents
will perceive sports as a viable career option and strive for sustained
sporting excellence on the world sporting stage.”</p>
