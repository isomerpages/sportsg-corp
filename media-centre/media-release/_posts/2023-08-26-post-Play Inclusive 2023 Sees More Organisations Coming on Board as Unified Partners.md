<h4>Highest number of participating organisations as Unified Partners, with first time participation by senior volunteers from RSVP Singapore</h4>
<p>SINGAPORE, 26 AUGUST 2023 – Play Inclusive, Singapore’s biggest unified
sport competition will have more than 650 athletes with disabilities and
their Unified Partners (UP), players without disabilities, taking part
in its sixth edition. Held over two days, on 26 August and 16 September
2023, Play Inclusive 2023 will also see the highest number of organisations
taking part as UP – a total of 31 organisations, up from 27 in 2019 – partnering
Special Education (SPED) schools and disability centres across six sports.
This year, the six sports are Badminton, Basketball, Boccia, Floorball,
Football and Goalball.</p>
<p>Play Inclusive 2023 was officially opened by Guest-of-Honour Mr Eric Chua,
Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth
&amp; Ministry of Social and Family Development. The first day of competition
at OCBC Arena saw about 310 athletes with disabilities playing alongside
their UP across four sports - Basketball, Boccia, Floorball and Goalball.
About 340 participants are expected to compete on the second day of the
competition (16 September) in Badminton and Football.</p>
<p>Athlete Daiyan Aniq Mohammed Faizal, 17-year-old from Delta Senior School
together with unified partner Lee Xinyi, 19-year-old from Ngee Ann Polytechnic
led in the recitation of the Special Olympics oath – Let me win. But if
I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt – a demonstration of the uniting
power of sports and how persons with disabilities can increase their self-determination
and self-worth through friendly competition.</p>
<p>Dr Teo-Koh Sock Miang, President of Special Olympics Singapore and Singapore
Disability Sports Council, underscored the power of sport in uniting people
of all abilities, “The Play Inclusive competition is the culmination of
an eight-week training phase between athletes and their Unified Partners.
For athletes with disabilities, friendships are formed when they train
and play side-by-side with their Unified Partners, who themselves develop
empathy, greater sensitivity and understanding of, and respect for persons
with disabilities.”</p>
<p>Mr Marcus Tan, Chief of Sport Development Group overseeing Sport Singapore’s
philanthropic arm SportCares, is grateful towards the continued support
from Unified Partners. Mr Tan said, "Unified sport encourages shared sporting
experiences between persons with and without disabilities to promote inclusion
in the community. Through Play Inclusive, participants train and compete
alongside one another, building understanding and forging friendships using
sport as a common language. With RSVP Singapore The Organisation of Senior
Volunteers participation this year, more senior volunteers are also able
to take part and make new acquaintances through Play Inclusive. These intergenerational
interactions will not only be beneficial for the athletes but also for
our seniors, who gain a sense of purpose and fulfilment in contributing
to the development of athletes with disabilities.”</p>
<p>Play Inclusive has seen strong support from various stakeholders including
schools, corporates and organisations. This year, corporates such as Certis
and RSVP Singapore The Organisation of Senior Volunteers, participated
in the event for the first time. On its partnership with Muscular Dystrophy
Association (Singapore), Ms Edna Claudine Leong, Executive Director of
RSVP Singapore shared, “As a society, we must have the conviction that
everyone can contribute to the larger society in which we appreciate and
value one another. Through initiatives like Play Inclusive, our senior
volunteers get to team up with younger players in boccia and form intergeneration
bonds. We believe that seniors can help instil the importance of inclusivity
and use the power of sport to bring persons of all abilities together."</p>
<p>Anglican High School has been teaming up with St Andrew's Autism School
(SAAS) in Unified basketball and badminton in 2019, 2022 and 2023. Mr Alaric
Leong, teacher at Anglican High School commented, “I have witnessed firsthand
the positive impact of inclusive physical education and sport on our students.
Through these activities, students of all abilities come together, gaining
a better understanding and appreciation of one another. This is what we
are inculcating in our students, to contribute to the larger society where
we appreciate each other."</p>
<p>SAAS teacher, Ms Nurul Baizura Abdul Razak shared, "For students with
special needs, the interaction with their partner school peers helps to
build their confidence and social skills, contributing to their holistic
education. It is heartening to see the commitment to promote inclusive
sports by the organisers. These efforts are crucial in creating a more
inclusive and accepting society. The Play Inclusive trainings and competition
are one of the highlight events of the year for most of our students."</p>
<p>Play Inclusive 2023 is co-organised by SportCares, Special Olympics Singapore
and Singapore Disability Sports Council, with the support of participating
schools from the Ministry of Education.</p>

<p><strong><u>About Play Inclusive and the Unified Sport Competition Concept</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>SportCares, Special Olympics Singapore</strong>  <strong>and the Singapore Disability Sports Council,</strong> supported
by the <strong>Ministry of Education</strong>, have joined hands to co-organise
the annual Play Inclusive competition to promote inclusion in the community
through shared sporting experiences between persons with and without disabilities
and special needs.</p>
<p>The event was first introduced in 2018, with athletes with and without
intellectual disabilities forming unified teams to compete in four sports
– badminton, basketball, floorball, and football. In 2019, the competition
format was expanded to include goalball, a sport for persons with visual
impairment, as well as a sport skills challenge. Boccia was included into
Play Inclusive only in 2022.</p>
<p>Special Education schools and disability centres are paired with general
education schools to form unified teams, where they train for eight to
twelve weeks together before competing in the finale events. These participants
with and without disabilities are termed as athletes and unified partners
respectively.</p>
<p>For events that include persons with intellectual disabilities, a process
called ‘divisioning’, where athletes are assessed for their playing abilities
and then placed in a division where the athletes’ skills are similar, is
used to ensure equal and quality participation. The presence of unified
partners in each team is to encourage and facilitate meaningful game play,
and penalties are imposed if unified partners dominate the game.</p>
