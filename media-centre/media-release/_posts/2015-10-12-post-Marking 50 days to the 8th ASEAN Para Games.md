### **Community Engagement Initiatives Intensify Marking 50 days to the 8th ASEAN Para Games**
_Opportunities available for the community to come together as One Team Singapore_  
  
**Singapore, 12 October 2015** – The Singapore ASEAN Para Games Organising Committee (SAPGOC) today revealed the different community initiatives to involve and excite Singaporeans in the lead up to the Games, build affinity for our Team Singapore athletes, while at the same time, gain insights into this specialised domain of sport.  
  
Marking the 50-day countdown to the Games, the community can expect to see a ramp up of initiatives from 13 October 2015, such as the “Unbreakable” music video that aims to showcase the indomitable spirit of our athletes, the Gift-a-NILA community initiative and the launch of the “Get RED-y” campaign to rally the community together to support and cheer on our athletes.  

Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu said, “In about 50 days, Singapore will host the ASEAN Para Games for the first time. This is an extraordinary opportunity for all of us to experience the power of disability sport. Our athletes are training hard and ready to fly the Singapore flag high. Let’s all come together to support and celebrate our athletes as One Team Singapore!”

##### **"Unbreakable"music video**  
  
The “Unbreakable” music video aims to highlight the intensive trainings that our Team Singapore athletes have to go through as well as the mental and physical rigours required of their respective sports. The video also serves to tell the story that our athletes are “unbreakable” with our support and can overcome the odds in their pursuit of glory for the nation.  
  
The video features Team Singapore athletes who have displayed the unbreakable spirit through their success – Theresa Goh (Swimming), Tay Wei Ming (Badminton), Jovin Tan (Sailing), Khairul Anwar (Cerebral Palsy Football), Nurulasyiqah Mohammad Taha (Boccia) and Toh Sze Ning (Boccia).  
  
The music video will premiere on 13 October 2015 and will be available on SAPGOC social media platforms.  
  
##### **“Get RED-Y!”**  
  
To drum up excitement around the nation, SAPGOC will be embarking on a “Get RED-Y!” movement to build affinity and garner support for our athletes. 

As part of the campaign, school cheer kits will be given out to 100 schools. Each kit includes a Team Singapore temporary tattoo and cheer card for students to pen down their well wishes for the Team Singapore athletes.

The movement will also see the dressing of housing estates and community spaces, from lamp posts to public transport vehicles such as buses and MRT trains. A series of 15 posters featuring a Team Singapore athlete from each sport will be found on billboards and banners in schools and ActiveSG centres all over Singapore. The movement calls for every Singaporean to adopt the colour red in support of Team Singapore.

Mr Toh Boon Yi, Chief, Corporate and Community Outreach, SAPGOC, added, “Our Team Singapore athletes represent our country competing at international tournaments. They have put in years of hard work and sacrifice to get to where they are, which is by all means, no easy feat. We want to celebrate this spirit of excellence. We hope more of our athletes will become household names and urge the community to get behind them as part of One Team Singapore.”  
  
Says Team Singapore swimmer Yip Pin Xiu, “It is a great feeling, knowing that we have the community cheering us on come December. An enthusiastic home crowd will definitely spur us to push our limits and to do Singapore proud.”  
  
##### **Gift-a-NILA**

The Gift-A-NILA initiative provides the community with an opportunity to contribute to the Games in a meaningful way by sewing and decorating heart-shaped mini cushions which will then be eventually stitched on to NILA plush toys.

A total of 3,000 creatively decorated hearts will be given to all participating athletes and officials as part of their welcome pack. Members of the public who are interested in contributing to this initiative can make their way down to Marina Square on 24-25 October to do so.  
  
Beyond these initiatives, other events and opportunities for the community to come together as part of the 8th ASEAN Para Games include:  

* Unified Powerlifting Invitational on 24 and 25 October 2015
* APG “Sport without Boundaries” Roadshows at Sengkang and Pasir Ris on 7 and 8 November 2015 respectively
* “One Team Singapore” Rally on 14 November 2015
