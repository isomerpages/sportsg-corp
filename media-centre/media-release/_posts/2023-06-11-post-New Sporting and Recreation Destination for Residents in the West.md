* Comprising sport facilities such as hockey field, football fields and multi-purpose sheltered courts, the new ActiveSG Sport Village@ Jurong Town will provide the community increased opportunities to lead a healthy lifestyle through sport.
* The facility has been opened for public use and booking since 26 April 2023.

**Singapore, 11 June 2023** – ActiveSG Sport Village@ Jurong Town was officially opened this morning by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Advisor for Jurong Grassroots Organisations, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Jurong GRC Advisors, Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Health and Ministry of Law, Mr Shawn Huang, and Mr Xie Yao Quan were also at the event to engage with residents. With the opening of the ActiveSG Sport Village@ Jurong Town, members of the public and residents from the surrounding neighbourhoods will have access to quality facilities for sports such as, football, hockey, pickleball and tennis. There are also sheltered multi-sport courts for sports such as basketball, futsal and handball.

Sustainability is a key feature in the design of the facility. It has sustainable features, such as a rainwater collection system and a jogging track made from recycled materials. The hockey field was built to enable the water to be collected from it and used to irrigate the grass football fields and the facility’s landscaping. The jogging track that loops around the facility, with distance markers to cater for varying exercise routines, is made with rubber granules recycled from used sports shoes.

“This new Sport Village is a wonderful addition in Jurong. All over the island, we must make the most of these community sports facilities to enjoy ourselves, and to bond with each other, young and old.” said Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Adviser for Jurong Grassroots Organisations.

The ActiveSG Sport Village @ Jurong Town is part of Sport Singapore’s Sports Facilities Master Plan (SFMP) which aims to provide accessible and affordable facilities for everyone’s participation in sport and physical activities within a 10-minute walk from their homes by around 2030. There are four-tiers of sport facilities under the SFMP, serving the community's sporting needs at the National, Regional, Town and Neighbourhood levels. The SFMP is a key initiative of Vision 2030, the national sport blueprint. In recent years, the sporting facilities in Jurong have seen increased demand and high utilisation due to the growing number of people living in the area. With the opening of ActiveSG Sport Village@Jurong Town, a Tier 3 sport facility under the SFMP, residents in the area will have more opportunities to participate in sport.

“ActiveSG Sport Village@ Jurong Town is part of our efforts to bring quality sporting infrastructure closer to the community. We hope that the community will be able to lead a healthy lifestyle through sport with the increased access and create new memories and experiences together,” Mr Lim Hong Khiang, Chief, Sport Infrastructure Group, Sport Singapore.
