### **JR NBA Programme returns to Singapore for second consecutive year**  
_Registration Now Open for Clinics, Coaches Workshop and Regional Training Programme_  
  
SINGAPORE, 24 May, 2017 – The National Basketball Association (NBA) and Sport Singapore (SportSG) today announced that the Jr. NBA, the league’s global youth basketball programme for boys and girls, will return to Singapore for the second consecutive year.  
  
The Jr. NBA Singapore 2017 will be held from 16 June to 13 August and will teach participants the fundamental skills and the core values of the game, including sportsmanship, teamwork, respect and a positive attitude. The programme is again co-organised and presented by SportSG’s ActiveSG Basketball Academy.  
  
“We look forward to the return of the Jr. NBA to give more children the chance to learn and grow through playing basketball, and to help them develop a passion for the sport,” said Mr. Neo Beng Siang, Principal of the ActiveSG Basketball Academy and head coach of the Singapore Slingers. “Following the conclusion of last year’s Jr. NBA Singapore programme, a large number of participants joined the ActiveSG Basketball Academy because they wanted to continue playing basketball, a strong testament to the efficacy of the Jr. NBA programme. Together with the NBA, we hope to continue developing the game in order to expand the pool of players in Singapore and for our national team.”  
  
“We believe there is a real opportunity to improve the youth basketball experience and enhance player health and wellness by implementing guidelines for how the game should be played and taught at the grassroots level,” said NBA Asia Vice President, Global Marketing Partnerships, Francesco Suarez. “With the continued support of SportSG, we look forward to bringing the Jr. NBA experience to more youth, coaches and parents in Singapore for many years to come.” The programme will tip off on 16 June with a coaches workshop for all participating coaches. The workshop will be followed by a two-day open clinic for boys and girls from 17-18 June at the “Our Tampines Hub” sports hall. A regional training programme, comprised of six training sessions to determine the top 200 boys and girls aged 10-14 who will participate in the Jr. NBA Singapore National Training Camp, will begin 1 July. The National Training Camp, a three-day intensive training camp held from 11-13 August at the Heartbeat@Bedok Sports Hall, will once again be attended by a current or former NBA player and will culminate with the selection of eight boys and eight girls to the Jr. NBA Singapore All-Star team. The standout campers will embark on a unique overseas NBA experience together with fellow Jr. NBA All-Stars from Southeast Asia later in the year.  
  
The Jr. NBA programme is free and open to boys and girls ages 5-14. Players between the ages of 10-14 will be eligible for top selection during the regional training programme to advance to the National Training Camp.  
  
The Jr. NBA, teaches the fundamental skills as well as the core values of the game at the grassroots level in an effort to help grow and improve the youth basketball experience for players, coaches and parents. During the 2016-17 season, the NBA will reach more than 18 million youth in 53 countries through its youth participation initiatives.
