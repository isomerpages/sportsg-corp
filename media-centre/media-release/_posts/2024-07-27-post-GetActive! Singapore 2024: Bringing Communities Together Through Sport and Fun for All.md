<p><em>GetActive! Singapore celebrates Singapore’s 59th birthday with a slew of inclusive and engaging activities for all across the island, fostering bonds between family and friends and promoting an active lifestyle through sport</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 27 July 2024 </strong>– GetActive! Singapore (GASG)
2024, the annual National Day celebration through sport, returns for its
ninth edition this year. Taking place from 27 July to 11 August 2024, this
year’s GASG is more inclusive and accessible than ever, with an array of
activities that cater to both the masses and specific segments of the community
such as children, youths, seniors, and persons with disabilities. Made
possible through Sport Singapore’s (SportSG) partnerships with key collaborators,
highlights include an expanded programme and new public component for inclusive
sports competition <strong>Play Inclusive; </strong>the first ever co-organised <strong>Nurture Kids Day Out</strong> with
a preschool anchor operator; an all-new annual sports festival <strong>Youth@Play</strong> for
youths; as well as the return of intergenerational bonding between school
children and seniors at the <strong>Seniors’ Sports Day – ActiveX Playdate</strong>.
This year’s GASG also includes the second edition of <strong>Majulah Fiesta</strong>,<strong> </strong>organised
in collaboration with Kallang Alive Sport Management (KASM), at the Singapore
Sports Hub.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Civil Service Club’s Public Service Sports and
Family Day (PSSFD), the highly anticipated GASG 2024 kickoff event saw
more than 3,000 people gathered at the OCBC Square of the Singapore Sports
Hub. GASG 2024 was officially launched by guest-of-honour Minister for
Culture, Community and Youth &amp; Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong.
The day began with attendees of all ages moving along to the GASG Workout
2024: Dance of the Nation (DOTN), choreographed to this year’s National
Day Parade (NDP) theme song, ‘Not Alone’. Also being celebrated was Olympic
Day – made extra special due to it coinciding with the opening of the Paris
2024 Olympics. Attendees gathered to join in the 3.8km Olympic Day Walk
around the Singapore Sports Hub’s vicinity, in celebration of the Olympic
spirit and as a show of support for Team Singapore and their pursuit of
excellence.</p>
<p>GASG 2024 offers all patrons access to a wider assortment of sport experiences,
competitions, and activities, regardless of their background or ability.
In line with Singapore’s National Day celebrations, GASG’s increased offerings
provide more opportunities for Singapore residents to participate in the
festivities and bond through sport.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the significance of GASG, Mr Alan Goh, Chief Executive Officer
of SportSG said, “Since its inception in 2016, GASG has evolved beyond
just encouraging active living among residents. Today, GASG represents
the Singapore Spirit, embodying our unity and collective commitment to
a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp;This year’s edition includes an expanded Pesta
Sukan that features a Community Championship that aims to foster a ‘kampung’
spirit among participants, and furthers our outreach to our&nbsp;communities
including children, youths, seniors and persons with disabilities. The
strong support we receive from like-minded partners such as schools, institutes
of higher learning (IHL), public agencies and private organisations have
been instrumental in enabling us to co-create programmes that help empower,
engage and bring together our communities in celebration of our National
Day&nbsp;through sport and active play.”</p>
<p><strong><u>Inclusive Events Bringing Together Diverse Communities</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Through inclusive events such as Play Inclusive and Seniors’ Sports Day
– ActiveX Playdate, different communities can come together to bond and
learn from each other, while embracing an active lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Seniors’ Sports Day — ActiveX Playdate (1 August)*</strong>
</p>
<p>Seniors’ Sports Day will take place on 1 August at the Singapore Sports
Hub’s OCBC Arena, and provides a platform for seniors to celebrate National
Day through active play. The one-day event, now into its fourth year, also
marks the first anniversary of ActiveX, an initiative that promotes active
ageing as part of the Ministry of Health’s Refreshed Action Plan for Successful
Ageing and encourages intergenerational bonding through sport.</p>
<p>This year, almost 2,000 participants, comprising school-going children
and seniors from active ageing centres, are expected to come together to
participate in modified sports competitions and other sports tryouts. Here,
the students will be taking the lead, coaching and supporting the seniors
as they compete together in modified sports such as seated volleyball and
walking football. Both groups will also come together to test their aim,
agility and dexterity in activities such as arcade basketball, air hockey
and ladder toss.</p>
<p><strong>Play Inclusive (3 and 17 August)*</strong>
</p>
<p>Play Inclusive, Singapore’s largest inclusive sports competition, returns
for its seventh edition with an expanded variety of sports tailored to
a broader range of disabilities. Held over two days (3 and 17 August) at
the Singapore Sports Hub, the event fosters community inclusion by creating
a platform where friendships are forged and acceptance is cultivated through
shared sporting experiences. The Play Inclusive competition marks the culmination
of a three-month training period for athletes and their unified partners,
featuring over 1,200 participants across two days. This year, the competition
introduces five new events to its lineup, including soundball and wheelchair
rugby.</p>
<p>For the first time, the event is also open to members of the public (only
on 3 August), to participate in inclusive sports such as wheelchair rugby,
goalball, football, cycling, floorball, blind running, boccia, shooting
and para athletics. This initiative aims to promote greater understanding
of persons with disabilities, fostering a more inclusive society.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Supporting Specific Communities and Interest Groups</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to larger scale, mass events that target the entire community,
SportSG is also working closely with key partners on events for specific
demographics and interest groups. These seek to empower and encourage these
communities to pursue active living, even beyond GASG.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lion City Dance Convention (27 July to 4 August)*</strong>
</p>
<p>A platform for Singapore’s vibrant street dance community to come together,
the Lion City Dance Convention (LCDC) at the Singapore Sports Hub supports
the street dance community by providing learning and competition opportunities
with renowned dance studios and instructors. Now into its fourth year,
LCDC has since become a mainstay in Singapore’s street dance calendar,
attracting competitors from not just Singapore, but overseas as well.</p>
<p>During the weekends (27-28 July, 3-4 August), street dancers – both solo
and dance crews – will battle it out in street dance styles such as locking,
breaking and popping, with competitions across both junior (aged 17 and
below) and open categories. On weekdays (29 July to 2 August), dance enthusiasts
or those simply looking to dip their toes into the world of street dance
can sign up for dance workshops, where they will learn from some of the
best street dancers in Singapore, as well as renowned names hailing from
Malaysia, Philippines and France.</p>
<p><strong>Nurture Kids Day Out (30 July)*</strong>
</p>
<p>Nurture Kids Day Out sees a refreshed concept this year. A staple since
2018, the Nurture Kids Festival has been renamed ‘Nurture Kids Day Out’
for the 2024 edition, and this is the first year that SportSG is co-organising
the event with a local preschool anchor operator. This allowed early childhood
educators to be actively involved in designing the activities, having gone
through capability development workshops with SportSG on how to integrate
movement as a way of life for preschoolers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nurture Kids Day Out is a culmination of all the skills they have gathered,
with more than 3,200 preschoolers, educators and parents coming together
to experience fun and enjoyable movement and play experiences. Happening
on 30 July at OCBC Arena, the event will showcase innovative movement strategies
and activity ideas, incorporating National Day elements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The co-organised event was developed on the back of the ‘Fun Start Move
Smart – Learning to Move, Moving to Learn’ Resource Guide, launched by
SportSG in August 2023, and the capability development initiatives that
early childhood educators use to emphasise the importance of getting children
to move anytime, anywhere and throughout the day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Sport Festival for Youths — Youth@Play (6 August)*</strong>
</p>
<p>At this all-new annual sport festival for youths, Youth@Play promises
an exciting day of sport tryouts and opportunities for participants to
showcase their talent. Happening at the Singapore Sports Hub on 6 August,
youths aged 16 to 27 will be able to explore new sports experiences, ignite
their interest in active sport participation, and socialise with peers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sport workshops available for youths to try out include dragon boat and
kayak, pickleball, rock climbing and bouldering, skateboarding and street
dance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Celebrate National Day with More Fun and Entertainment at the Singapore Sports Hub</u></strong>
