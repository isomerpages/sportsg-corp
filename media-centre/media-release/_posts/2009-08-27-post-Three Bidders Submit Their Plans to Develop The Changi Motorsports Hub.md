### **Three Bidders Submit Their Plans to Develop The Changi Motorsports Hub**

**Singapore, 27 August 2009** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today that three bidding consortia submitted their tender proposals to design, build, finance and manage the Changi Motorsports Hub (CMH) at 4 pm today.

Tender bid submissions were delivered to the SSC by the following consortia:
* SG Changi Pte Ltd
* Singapore Agro Agriculture Pte Ltd
* Sports Services Ltd

Set to become one of Asia's first premier motorsports and entertainment centre, the CMH will feature top-notch motorsports facilities and amenities for motorsports enthusiasts, businesses, consumers and tourists.

The CMH will sit on a 41-hectare sea-facing site near Changi Airport and will be conveniently connected to the city's key tourist attractions and landmarks as well as the central business district. Expected to be ready by the end of 2011, the Hub will feature a permanent racetrack of at least 3.5 kilometres, along the Changi coastline, complemented with a permanent sheltered grandstand for at least 8,000 spectators. The design of the racetrack will also strive to maximize spectator viewing experience.

The SSC made key specification changes following bidder feedback which increases the commercial viability and design optimisation for the project. SSC also raised the total motorsports and commercial Gross Floor Area (GFA) from 13,000 sqm to 67,000 sqm - of which 35,000 sqm is for commercial GFA.

"Despite the challenging economic climate, we're very happy to update that three consortia have submitted their bids. It is a good indication that the value proposition for the Changi Motorsports Hub remains strong. We look forward to the evaluation process and to awarding the project by the first quarter of 2010. This milestone will take Singapore one step closer to becoming a premier motorsports destination in the years to come," said Alex Chan, Chairman of the Singapore Sports Council.

The evaluation panel will comprise Government agencies as well as project consultants.

The successful consortium is expected to be appointed by the first quarter of 2010.

Bids will be evaluated on five criteria:
1. Ability to position CMH as the preferred venue for international motorsports events (40%)
2. Contribution towards developing a centre of excellence for motorsports training and education (20%)
3. Financial and business sustainability of proposal (20%)
4. Contribution towards developing local motorsports ecosystem (10%)
5. Attractiveness of commercial mix and events (10%)
