### **Another First For The Asian Youth Games - Official Website Launched**

_Website to be the primary broadcast platform for the inaugural Asian Youth Games_

The Singapore Asian Youth Games Organising Committee (SAYGOC) crossed yet another milestone today with the launch of its website - www.ayg2009.sg. Developed by the World Sport Group, together with Perform Group and Content Craft, the new website is a one-stop portal for the inaugural AYG.

The website is symbolic of the SAYGOC's efforts to showcase Singapore's technological prowess through its new media approach. The AYG will be breaking new grounds by broadcasting its sports events 'live' primarily via its official website during the games period. It is the first multi-sport event to receive approval from the Olympic Council of Asia to provide broadcast coverage of all its sports events completely via digital channels. By leveraging on new media capabilities, the SAYGOC aims to bring the AYG closer to all youths across Asia.

With up to four concurrent 'live' streams, visitors will be able to catch some of the action that will be happening at the AYG 'live' in the comfort of their own homes. The schedule of events to be broadcasted 'Live' will be available on the website closer to the commencement of the AYG. In addition, the AYG Opening and Closing Ceremonies will also be broadcast 'live' via the website. For those pressed for time, Video On-Demand Clips capturing key sporting highlights of the various games will be made available.

The website will also feature a comprehensive digital library, showcasing a collection of videos of the 10-sport events that will be featured at the AYG and interviews with Team Singapore athletes and officials who will be representing the nation. The website also carries a compilation of photos of key moments captured at the AYG competition. During the games period, the photo library will be populated with pictures reflecting the highlights of each sport at the various venues.

An added dimension allows for the public to uncover pertinent information on the AYG from the website. Adorned with the colours of the AYG, the website includes details on the sports events, snippets of the action at the competition venues, list of participating countries, and information on where the public can purchase exclusive AYG merchandise and event tickets.

In addition, the website will be an avenue for SAYGOC to effectively engage the youth community in Asia. Interactive features such as an AYG Community message board and media portals have been incorporated into the site to create a social network-like setting and allow users to contribute stories, videos and photos related to the AYG. Visitors will be encouraged to participate in various contests and other fun-filled activities.

Mr Jose Raymond, Head of the IT & Communications Sub Committee, SAYGOC, said, "The AYG official website is a one-stop portal for the 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009. With Singapore being one of the most connected cities in the world, we felt that it was apt to leverage on our new media capabilities to bring the AYG to the communities in Asia. This initiative will further boost Singapore's efforts in developing the local sports media industry in a way that keeps it relevant and engaging."

"This is the first time that a multi-sport event is employing new media channels as its primary broadcast platform - another first for SAYGOC. The website has something for everybody - interactive features to engage the community to share their thoughts on the AYG, video-on-demand to enable visitors to re-live the highlights of the various sport events and 'live' streaming of key events so that youths across Asia can be part of the sporting action at the AYG," he added.

**About the 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009**<br>
The Asian Youth Games (AYG) is an international multi-sports event held every four years to complement the existing Asian Games. The idea was first mooted as part of Singapore's Youth Olympic Games bid in 2007. On 3 April 2008, the Olympic Council of Asia's (OCA) Executive Board unanimously agreed to award the hosting of the first AYG to Singapore. This decision was backed by all 45 members of the OCA on 6 April 2008. The inaugural AYG, which is co-organised by the Singapore Sports Council and the Ministry of Education, aims to gather the youth from around Asia in a celebration of youth, sports and learning, where they will engage in friendly competition and imbibe the Olympic sporting values of excellence, friendship and respect. AYG Singapore 2009 will see athletes aged between 14 and 17 from 45 OCA member nations competing in 90 events across nine sports from 29 June to 7 July 2009.
