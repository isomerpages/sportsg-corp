### **60,000 Runners Make Inaugural Race A Resounding Success**


**Singapore, 5 December 2010** - History was made today as a record-breaking 60,000 runners took to the streets at the inaugural Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) 2010. Flagged off from three different start points, runners found themselves pounding through some of Singapore's key iconic landmarks, which included Orchard Road, Chinatown, Sentosa, Universal Studios Singapore, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer.

2. Commenting on the success of the inaugural race which was organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), David Voth, Chairman, SCMS 2010 Organising Committee and Senior Director, Sports Marketing Group, SSC, said, "I am extremely pleased with the race today and the success of the inaugural race would not have been possible without the support of all our partners and stakeholders. Our aim has always been to make the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore an event not just for runners but for the community as well. Looking at the spectacular turnout of runners and supporters today, I'm confident we are on track to fulfil our vision of the Marathon becoming Asia's pinnacle race."

3. Runners and supporters were also impressed by the event this year. Joan Low said "The race this year has been amazing. It was a treat to run past so many of Singapore's key iconic landmarks. It made the run a lot more aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. I really enjoyed myself and the early start at 5am also helped as the weather was cool throughout the run and over the entire course."

4. Supporters at the event were equally drawn to the festivities at the Padang; Anna Poon, who brought her whole family to the event, had this to say, "We are actually here to support my husband but we got distracted by the many activities happening at the Padang. My kids have thoroughly enjoyed themselves through the games and contests held at the Kids' Zone, and as for myself, I had fun taking part in the Trigger-Happy Photography Competition."

5. For the inaugural race this year, the SCMS 2010 Organising Committee from the SSC worked closely with local stakeholders and organisations to collectively bring to life a marathon that was Uniquely Singapore. With the aim of developing the vision of a running culture in Singapore, the Organiser launched many new initiatives such as three different start points and running routes, a revised prize money structure and inviting renowned Boston Marathon race director, Dave McGillivray to oversee the race. With these initiatives, the Organiser hopes to raise the quality of the race, strengthen its profile and eventually increase the participation figure to 100,000 in five years time and fulfil the vision of making the event a "people's marathon".

6. Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. George Yeo was the Guest-of-Honour for the Full Marathon, which was flagged off at 5.00am at Orchard Road for the first time. 20,000 runners passed under a flood of Christmas lights. Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, flagged off the Half-marathon at 6.30 am where 15,000 runners started the race at the Sentosa Gateway, bringing them through the island of Sentosa and amidst the sights and sounds of Universal Studios Singapore. The 10 KM Run was flagged off at 7.45am by Mr Seah Kian Peng, Member of Parliament for Marine Parade GRC, on the Esplanade Bridge, where 20,000 runners began their race.

7. Kenneth Mburu Mungara and Irene Jerotich Kosgei took home the champions title while Mok Ying Ren and Qi Hui went away as winners of the local category.

8. Kenneth Mburu Mungara was the first to come in with a time of 02:14.06. It was a close finish as Thomas Cherogony and Vincent Krop followed shortly behind, completing the Full Marathon with a time of 02:14.32 and 02:14.57 respectively. Kenneth Mburu Mungara was awarded with a prize money of US$50,000 (S$66,500). Mungara said, "The Singapore race is good and enjoyable but also very hot. I broke away at the 30 km mark and I knew that if I maintained my pace, I would win. I tried to clock a good time but it was difficult as the first half of the race was quite slow but I'm happy with the win. The prize money is not just for me but for my entire family."

9. It was an equally close race in the women's open category, which saw Irene Jerotich Kosgei emerging top of her field with a time of 2:35.22, just 9 seconds ahead of Ayelu Lemma Geda who finished with a time of 02:35.31. Annerien van Schalkwyk completed the top three with a time of 02:35.32. Irene Jerotich Kosgei went home with a prize money of US$50,000 (S$66,500). An ecstatic Irene said, "I can say the race is really nice although it was a little bit humid. The course is very, very stable. I have no problems with my run. However, I couldn't run under 2:29.00 because of the weather."

10. Mok Ying Ren stamped his authority as the champion in the men's local category (Full Marathon) with a time of 02:38.28. He was also the winner of the men's local category (Full Marathon) in the 2009 edition of the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon. Ashley Liew Wei Yen secured second place with a time of 02:52.29, while Ramesh s/o Palaniandy took third place with a time of 02:52.55.

11. Over in the women's local category (Full Marathon), Qi Hui topped the category with 03:12.24, just 11 minutes ahead of Elaine Lim who finished with a time of 03:23.21. Jeradine Collett came in with a time of 03:24.19, rounding up the top three in that category.
