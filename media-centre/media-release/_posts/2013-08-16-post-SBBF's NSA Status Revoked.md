### **SBBF's NSA Status Revoked**

**Singapore, 16 August 2013** - Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today that the Singapore Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation's (SBBF) National Sports Association (NSA) status has been revoked with immediate effect.

2. The revocation is in response to the recent developments in SBBF, which had called into question its ability and credibility to carry out its responsibilities and obligations as the national governing body for the sport of bodybuilding.

3. On 10 April this year, SSC had asked the SBBF to explain and clarify issues of concern related to doping at the Singapore National Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championships; its de-affiliation by Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC); and other governance matters.

4. SBBF failed to make a representation by the given deadline - 30 April 2013. When SSC officers met Dr Rano Izhar Rahmat, President, SBBF on 8 May 2013, he acknowledged the Notice but did not address the concerns and issues satisfactorily.

5. After careful and thorough consideration, SSC has concluded that the SBBF can no longer represent or serve the interest of the sport and its athletes in the capacity of a national governing body.

6. "The leadership of SBBF has consistently shown its inability to lead the sport of bodybuilding - morally and operationally. The blatant doping violations and administrative incompetence has caused fragmentation within the bodybuilding fraternity. This decision is made to start to restore credibility and to rebuild the sport of bodybuilding," said Bob Gambardella, Chief of Sports Development Group, SSC.
