A total of 55 delegates from 40 Asian countries attended the two-day session.

During the meeting, SAYGOC unveiled the sports participation details for the AYG.

The committee is seeking inputs from the chefs de mission and are in consultation with Olympic Council of Asia for the system. Reference will be taken from the entries by name and the system will kick in when the participation entry numbers are more definite. Each participating nation will have till end-April 2009 to submit their entries by name to SAYGOC.

In addition, the delegates were also provided with details of the medical facilities and other pertinent services that will be made available to their contingents during the Games period. The Ministry of Health will be supporting SAYGOC in the delivery of the medical services during the AYG.

Professor Tay Boon Keng, Senior Consultant, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of the Singapore General Hospital, will helm the AYG's medical services as Chief Medical Officer. Apart from being responsible for the planning, preparation and implementation of AYG's medical services plan, Professor Tay will also be the main contact point to the OCA's Medical Committee and Anti-Doping Commission. A Medical Committee within SAYGOC will be supporting Professor Tay in his all-important tasks.

Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer, SSC and Co-Chair of SAYGOC, said, "The preparations for the landmark Asian Youth Games have gained significant momentum in recent weeks. The gathering of the delegates of the Chefs de Mission Meeting is critically important in helping us to put together the final finer details for the organisation of the games. We are very encouraged by the valuable inputs and feedback which will help us to move ahead with a lot of things. This can only further spur us to deliver a memorable event for athletes, officials and spectators alike. As we put in the final building blocks to the inaugural Asian Youth Games, we look forward to the continued strong support from all partners from the private, public and people sectors - volunteers, and the community at large."

The AYG, which will be held from 29 June to 7 July 2009, is set to feature almost 1,100 athletes across nine sports - aquatics (swimming and diving), athletics, FIBA33 (3-on-3 basketball), beach volleyball, bowling, football, sailing, shooting and table tennis.

**About the 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009**<br>
The Asian Youth Games (AYG) is an international multi--ports event held every four years to complement the existing Asian Games. The idea was first mooted as part of Singapore's Youth Olympic Games bid in 2007. On 3 April 2008, the Olympic Council of Asia's (OCA) Executive Board unanimously agreed to award the hosting of the first AYG to Singapore. This decision was backed by all 45 members of the OCA on 6 April 2008. The inaugural AYG, which is co-organised by the Singapore Sports Council and the Ministry of Education, aims to gather the youth from around Asia in a celebration of youth, sports and learning, where they will engage in friendly competition and imbibe the Olympic sporting values of excellence, friendship and respect. AYG Singapore 2009 will see athletes aged between 14 and 17 from 45 OCA member nations competing in 90 events across nine sports from 29 June to 7 July 2009.
