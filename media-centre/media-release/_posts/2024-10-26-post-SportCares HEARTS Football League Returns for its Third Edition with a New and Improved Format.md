<p><strong>Singapore, 26 October 2024 </strong>– The SportCares HEARTS Football
League 2024 Finale saw camaraderie, teamwork, and competitive spirit come
alive on the pitch at ActiveSG Woodlands Stadium as youths from the Saturday
Night Lights (SNL) programme gave their all in the final match this season<strong>. </strong>Back
for its third edition, the league also saw the youths competing in a<strong> </strong>new
and improved format, which included the addition of skill-based divisions
as well as promotion and relegation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organised by SportCares, the philanthropic arm of Sport Singapore (SportSG),
the SportCares HEARTS Football League, which was launched in 2022, aims
to provide youths from vulnerable backgrounds with opportunities to compete
in a supportive environment while fostering positive connections within
the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A total of 25 teams took part in this year’s league, including 19 teams
formed by 475 players from SNL (SportCares’ flagship football programme
for youths from vulnerable backgrounds) and six teams formed by SportCares'
partners such as Special Olympics Singapore, Tasek Sailors, Royal Arion
and Singapore Cricket Club. Teams were classified into three categories
– Men’s Division 1, Men’s Division 2 and Women’s Open.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The League’s Finale was graced by <strong>Mr Eric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth &amp; Ministry of Social and Family Development</strong>,
and saw close to 600 attendees and spectators, including the youths, their
families, and community partners. This year’s programme included a new
and improved format to enhance the competition experience through the introduction
of skill-based divisions, fostering fairer play and more positive growth.
The addition of promotion and relegation<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in the Men’s divisions also heightened
competition, pushing teams to strive for success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"The SportCares HEARTS Football League is more than just a competition.
It’s an extension of our SNL programme, which seeks to provide a safe space
for youths to learn life skills and positive values. At the same time,
it’s also about building an inclusive, welcoming, and supportive community,
where youths from all walks of life can bond through sport. As we continue
to look at increasing accessibility and promote inclusion in sport, we
hope that more corporates and sporting organisations can partner us in
this journey, so that we can do more for the community and enable more
people to benefit from our initiatives,” said<strong> Mr Shawn Lim, Head, SportCares, SportSG</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Lam Chee Weng, Chief Executive Officer, Singapore Pools (Private) Limited</strong>,
said, “Singapore Pools is proud to be a part of the SNL programme which
is a valuable platform for participants to build values and acquire life
skills through sport. Beyond our commitment to SNL, we partner SportCares
on initiatives like Football with a Heart, where we provide the invaluable
experience of playing on the National Stadium pitch to foster confidence,
teamwork, and resilience among youths. Together, we strive to uplift and
inspire the next generation while creating a more vibrant and supportive
community.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>"This year, my team made it to the finals for the first time, and I couldn't
be prouder. For the past year, we’ve gathered every Saturday night to train
hard as a team,” shared <strong>Zalikha Haidah, captain of District West Girls United, who came in 2nd in the Women’s Open category</strong>.
“Being the captain isn't just about skill — it's about responsibility and
inspiring the team to persevere. Through this competition, I’ve been given
the chance to be a role model, and that's something I carry with pride
both on and off the field.”</p>
