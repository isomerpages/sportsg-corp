### **Well-Wishing Campaign for Team Singapore launched**

_A passionate show of support for Beijing-bound athletes_

Team Singapore athletes received a boost of support to their preparations for the Beijing 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games when Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth & Sports (MCYS) officially launched the first Olympic well-wishing campaign as Guest of Honour at the IMM Mall today. This event is the first of a series of well-wishing activities organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) to rally Singaporeans behind the athletes as they get ready for the world's biggest sporting stage - the Beijing 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Making up the supporters were former Olympic paddler Jing Jun Hong and former Olympic sailor Siew Shaw Her and ten children from Sports On! Kids Club who were also present to show their support for the Team Singapore athletes. Well wishing campaign for the Olympic-bound athletes was the first activity organised for Sport On! Kids Club, which was also launched today. They have all attended the well wishing launch to cheer on the athletes.

Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer, SSC said, "Through this series of well-wishing activities, we strongly encourage all Singaporeans to support their athletes. Many have been training hard physically and mentally so as to do their best at the Games. Therefore, let's rally together behind these athletes and motivate them further by wishing them well. The well wishes will serve to inspire the athletes further knowing that they have the support of many at home. We are getting ever closer to reaching the dream of bringing an Olympic medal home so let's turn this dream into a reality."

In a bid to garner a total of 100,000 well wishes, various platforms with partners have been put together for Singaporeans to show their support for Team Singapore athletes. The public can obtain and drop their well-wishing cards into boxes placed at various locations, including 22 McDonald's restaurants, CapitaLand Malls, Samsung Flagship Store and at various SSC's sports facilities.

In addition, the public can look forward to two Olympic-themed road shows, which will be held at Jurong East Sports Hall on 29 June 2008 and the National Library on 19 July 2008. Singaporeans can expect to learn more about the Olympic movement and also pen their well wishes for Singapore's Olympic contingent at these roadshows. As part of the campaign, there will be a lucky draw where one lucky well wisher will win a travel package for two worth over S$6000 to the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.

The official send-off for the Team Singapore contingent headed for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games is on 2 August 2008. For more details on the well wishing campaign, please visit www.teamsingapore.com.sg.
