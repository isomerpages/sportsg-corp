<p><strong>Singapore, 6 December 2013</strong> - The Football Association
of Singapore (FAS) has today concluded its fourth annual FIFA Grassroots
Course and Festival, with some of its participants set to conduct junior
football programmes in collaboration with the Singapore Sports Council's
(SSC's) rebranded network of Super Sports Clubs, ActiveSG.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The FIFA Grassroots Course and Festival is designed to aid its participants,
also known as coach-educators, in acquiring international standards of
coaching children aged six to 12 years in football. The Course, which comprises
theoretical and practical sessions, prepares coach-educators to teach football
to children through encouragement and achievement. It also advocates that
they supervise, reassure and motivate children to play football for fun
as the best means of learning the sport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coach-educators from S.League clubs Warriors Football Club (FC), Home
United FC, and Balestier Khalsa FC, will be among the first batch of coaches
to deliver structured football programmes in partnership with ActiveSG
beginning next year. These programmes will be conducted with a deliberate
focus on providing children aged 12 years and below with playing opportunities
and enjoyable experiences in football. The programmes will also impart
sporting values such as leadership and teamwork to the junior participants
as part of their overall development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explaining how the partnership will raise the standards of football coaching
for children, Mr Lai Chin Kwang, Chief, Sports Club Group, SSC, said, "The
coach-educators will bring a different dimension to the football programmes
catered to children in our community. They will be able to apply what they
have acquired through the course to help these kids discover the joys of
football and initiate their learning through play. Under the guidance of
these coach-educators, these junior participants will come to appreciate
the values of working together as a team, showing respect to opponents
and demonstrating fair play during the game. In the long term, we can also
imbue leadership qualities through these football programmes."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Kok Wai Leong, Director of Operations, S.League, said, "The S.League
clubs are most supportive of the ActiveSG programme in promoting football
to the public. This is one of the ways S.League clubs can contribute back
to the community. It is also a continuing step in FAS' strategic plans
to promote and develop interest in football among children aged six to
12 years at the grassroots level. The annual FIFA Grassroots Course and
Festival will ensure that the kids benefit from age-appropriate coaching
and well-run football programmes."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirty coach-educators, majority of whom are from S.League clubs, attended
the Course, which had been held at Republic Polytechnic (RP) from 2 to
6 December and conducted under the supervision of Mr Samuel Schweingruber,
a FIFA instructor based in Cambodia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year's Course culminated in a festival where the coach-educators
conducted age-appropriate activities, featuring small sided games and individual
skill development drills, for more than 100 junior participants to improve
their technique and intelligence of the sport, as well as to boost their
enthusiasm for the beautiful game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Children develop differently from the youth and adolescents. Thus, it
is important for the coach-educators to be equipped with the suitable means
and methods to expose children to enjoyable experiences in football. The
course also encourages the coach-educators to adopt an educational approach
to covey values such as respect, solidarity, mutual support and sharing
to these kids through the sport. This will ultimately maximise participation
opportunities in grassroots football, which the local football and sports
authorities have clearly shown their support for," said Mr Schweingruber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A team of Final Year Project (FYP) students from RP's School of Sports,
Health and Leisure worked closely with FAS to prepare a presentation on
the importance of grassroots coaching in Singapore, which was delivered
during the course. RP is the only polytechnic in Singapore that has a dedicated
school for the education of future sports professionals, utilising its
unique Problem-based Learning (PBL) pedagogy.</p>
