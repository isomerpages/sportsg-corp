### **SINGSOC And SISO Join Hands For A Safe 28th SEA Games**


	
**Singapore, 8 July 2013** - The Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) and the Singapore Institution of Safety Officers (SISO) signed a two-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today, marking both parties' commitment to look into the safety aspects of the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Singapore.

2. Signed by SINGSOC Executive Committee (EXCO) Chairman Lim Teck Yin and SISO President Seet Choh San, the agreement will see the development and implementation of risk management plans for the 28th SEA Games.

3. This will cover games infrastructure such as temporary structures and venue overlays; games programming such as events and activities as well as general health and wellness such as haze management to ensure that they are in accordance with the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA) guidelines.

4. Mr Lim said: "We cannot take safety and wellbeing for granted. For an event that involves large numbers of people from Singapore and abroad, the organisers of the 2015 SEA Games have an obligation to ensure we provide a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. We are very happy to have SISO on board to help manage the safety aspects for the Games. This is the first of many partnerships we will establish in our journey towards 2015 with the object of co-creating the event, and sharing the sense of ownership and pride in being the hosts."

5. SISO and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) have collaborated on several fronts over the last few years. In 2009 for instance, SSC was a co-organiser of the Conference on Safety and Health in Research and Education (SHRE) by SISO. SSC was also a participant in the 2010 and 2011 editions of SHRE, where best practices in Safety and Health; technological advances and innovative ideas; emerging issues and requirements in Safety and Health were presented and discussed.

6. Mr Seet said: "SISO is pleased to collaborate with SINGSOC in the 2015 SEA Games. SISO members will conduct Risk Assessments on a pro-bono basis from 2013 to 2015. The work has started. This relationship is synergistic as SISO members are conversant with Risk Assessments and SEA Games 2015 has a need for Risk Assessments in preparation of the Games. SISO seeks to go beyond raising the domain knowledge of the WSH community and redefine the Safety Profession by providing opportunities for SISO members to contribute back to Singapore through initiatives such as the SEA Games."

7. SINGSOC earlier announced that the 28th SEA Games will be held in Singapore from 5th June to 16th June 2015. While the number and type of sports will be finalised at a later date, some sports like football will start its preliminary rounds a few days before the opening ceremony on 5 June 2015.
