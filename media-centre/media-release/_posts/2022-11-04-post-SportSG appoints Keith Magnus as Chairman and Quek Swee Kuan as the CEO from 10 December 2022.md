**Singapore, 4 November** – Sport Singapore (SportSG) has established the Kallang Alive Holding Co Pte Ltd to oversee the entire Kallang Alive precinct. A new entity under this Holding Company will manage the Singapore Sports Hub from 10 December 2022. SportSG has appointed Mr Keith Magnus as the Chairman and Mr Quek Swee Kuan as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the new entity. Both appointments will take effect on 1 December 2022. More details on the new entity will be announced in December.

2. Minister for Culture, Community and Youth & Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong said, “I am delighted to have Keith and Swee Kuan on board, to lead the Sports Hub. Their vision and energy will help bring to life our aspirations and vision for the Sports Hub to be a national icon for sporting, entertainment and lifestyle interests. Singaporeans will also be able to look forward to the Sports Hub, as a leading venue for community activities.”

3. Mr Magnus has been a Sport Singapore board member since 2020 and has recently been appointed the Co-Chairman for the SportCares Advisory Board. He sits on the SportSG Finance Committee and played a key role in the formulation of the Enhanced Sports Resilience Package, and the collaboration with SNOC on capacity 2 building for the sport ecosystem. As board member, he also played a key role in the Sports Hub Public-Private-Partnership review, and as Chief Negotiator for SportSG with Sports Hub Pte Ltd (SHPL), he was responsible for the successful and smooth conclusion to the project. Mr Magnus is the chairman of Evercore’s Asia business, a senior managing director in the firm and a member of the firm’s Global Management Committee. He also sits on the board of directors of The Anglo Chinese-Schools Foundation and Tech For Good Institute and is also chairman of the Centre for Fathering (“Dads for Life”) and other non-profit organisations. An avid rugby, soccer and F1 fan, Mr Magnus enjoys rugby, tennis and badminton, sports he used to represent his school during pre-tertiary days. 

4. Mr Quek is currently the CEO of New Business in Surbana Jurong (SJ), who is instrumental in formulating SJ’s next 5-year transformational growth plan which is being implemented. Prior to SJ, Mr Quek was the CEO of Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) and led SDC’s efforts in transforming Sentosa into a leading leisure and lifestyle resort destination. With 26 years of public service experience, including at the Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), Mr Quek is well versed in attracting investments and visitors to Singapore, through strategic branding, marketing, international relations and business development efforts. An avid football and F1 fan, Mr Quek enjoys a variety of sports and had represented his Junior College in canoeing and dragon boat competitions and was his faculty’s canoe-polo captain during his university days. 

5. Chairman of SportSG Kon Yin Tong said, “Keith and Swee Kuan bring a wealth of experience in driving organisational strategy and transformation and will be great assets to the Sports Hub. We are confident that they are well placed to steer the team as they navigate this next phase.”

6. SportSG announced on 10 June 2022 that it would take over ownership of the Sports Hub to maximise its potential, drive stronger social, sporting and economic outcomes for Singapore, and take advantage of the synergies with the Kallang Alive precinct development. The Sports Hub will offer the wider Singaporean community greater accessibility to sports, lifestyle and entertainment programming, whilst maintaining its commercial sustainability.

7. Incoming Chairman of the new entity Keith Magnus said, “Being part of the process in the government’s takeover of the Sports Hub was invaluable. The Government’s drive to create greater affinity and value for Singaporeans is paramount. Together with my board, Swee Kuan and his team, we will work hard to champion Sports Hub’s social, sporting and economic benefits for our people. The community can now look forward to welcoming a brand-new Sports Hub and enjoy many memorable, delightful experiences.” 

8. SportSG and SHPL have worked closely over the past few months to ensure that the handover to the new entity will be smooth and day-to-day operations and programmes would not be affected. Nearly 90% of staff from SHPL and over 95% of partners and vendors will be transitioning to the new entity. The team’s expertise and experience will ensure continuity in the deliverance of high-quality service and experience for visitors to the Sports Hub. 

9. Incoming CEO of the new entity Quek Swee Kuan said, “With its world class facilities, the Sports Hub has incredible potential to be a premier sporting, entertainment and lifestyle destination, and I am thrilled to take on this new challenge and responsibility. I am proud to be leading such an impressive team and I look forward to working with Mr Magnus and the team to make the Sports Hub and the Kallang Alive precinct a cherished and exciting place for all Singaporeans.” 

10. As part of the official handover on 10 December 2022, a series of community activities has been planned from the month of December. This will include a Sports Hub Opening Day on 10 December 2022, where members of the public will be able to enjoy live music, shop at the Bazaar, and try out different sports and fitness programmes such as football, volleyball, yoga, swimming and Zumba across the various Sports Hub venues and facilities. In addition, the Sports Hub will usher in the festive season with a Christmas light up and stunning pyrotechnic displays. Visitors can also expect more exciting activities over the Chinese New Year period. More details will be made available from 1 December 2022.
