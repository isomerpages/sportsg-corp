### **Panel Of Inquiry Set Up To Look Into Dragon Boat Incident**

Singapore, 4 December 2007 - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) announced today the names of the Panel of Inquiry (POI) formed to look into the Dragon Boat incident that occurred in Phnom Penh, Cambodia on 23 November 2007.

Leading the POI will be Brigadier General Bernard Tan Kok Kiang from the Ministry of Defence.

Said BG Tan: "The Dragon Boat incident is an unfortunate event that has impacted the sports fraternity. The POI will determine the factors that led to the incident and recommend hazard management and preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in future sports events held in Singapore as well as to reduce the risk exposure for our sportsmen and women participating in sports events held overseas."

Members of the POI were appointed by the SSC in consultation with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS).

The panel is expected to release its preliminary investigation findings within a couple of months.
