### **Celebrate Singapore's Hosting Of The 28th SEA Games & 8th ASEAN Para Games At Gardens by the Bay**
**_Ngee Ann Polytechnic celebrate everyday extraordinary efforts_**

Come 15 February, Singapore will celebrate the start of the 28th SEA Games and 8th ASEAN Para Games journeys in a sports carnival-cum-concert showcasing the launch of original SEA Games compositions by local bands and artistes and the official logos, mascot and theme of the Games.

Taking place at Gardens by the Bay, The Meadow, from 5:30pm till 11pm, Team Singapore athletes and their supporters will come together as part of the Singapore 2015 Launch Party to welcome back Team Singapore athletes from the 1st Special Olympics Asia Pacific Games in Australia and the 27th SEA Games and 7th ASEAN Para Games in Myanmar.

Graced by President Tony Tan Keng Yam, the party will see the official logos for both games unveiled by Team Singapore athletes at exactly 2015 hrs. The Games tagline and mascot will also be introduced.

Under the curation of the Music Director, Dr Sydney Tan, several local musicians have composed songs based on the theme for the Games and will be performing them at the party. The songs include:

*   You’re Almost There – written by Joel Tan (Gentle Bones) and Ruth Ling, performed by Joel Tan
*   Greatest – written and performed by Daphne Khoo
*   Forever – written by Joshua Wan and performed by The Steve McQueens
*   Still – written and performed by Charlie Lim

The adrenaline-pumping night would end with a party to the tunes spun by DJ Aldrin – one of Singapore’s most renowned disc jockey. Over the next few months, more songs with accompanying music videos will be introduced in the lead-up to 2015.

Mr Toh Boon Yi, Chief of Community & Corporate Outreach, Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) shared that, “The Games will celebrate the triumph of human spirit that occurs on a daily basis in everyday life. Everyone has an unique story to tell about overcoming challenges and we want to involve all Singaporeans in celebrating this triumph as we mark Singapore’s 50th Anniversary.”

**Something Worth Celebrating**

Over the past week, Voice, a Ngee Ann Polytechnic student-led group, has been holding a string of activities at their school, and at Jalan Besar Stadium – in a bid to spread the word that the SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games are coming to Singapore.

Elaborating on the concept, Managing Director of Voice and final-year student of NP, Terence Cheong says, “Though ordinary, it is the small little things in life that lead us to where we are and bring us a step closer to achieve the greater success in life. Hence, through Extraordinary Everyday, we aim to celebrate the little achievements in life; after all, it is the little things that leads to the extraordinary. Besides giving a reminder to Singaporeans that there is something worth celebrating in each and every one of us, we want to create an event that engages the entire nation. Since sports and arts bring people together, we came up with Extraordinary Art to excite members of the public using sports to create a beautiful montage that would be showcased at the Singapore 2015 Launch Party.”

Mr Toh added that, “We are very happy that communities such as Ngee Ann Poly’s final-year students have volunteered to kick-off this exciting journey. The involvement of our very talented local singers and composers also demonstrates that everyone can be a part of the Games as we host the Games again after 22 years.”

50 mosh pit tickets will be given out through the ‘Extraordinary’ activation events, and as prizes through Facebook contests.

**EXTRAORDINARY EVERYDAY**

Recognising the daily challenges everyone faces such as the daily challenges of students who climb up a steep slope to make it on-time for their lectures (a mammoth task to many!), unsuspecting students bumped into the Voice “Welcome Party” and were given a goodie-bag, consisting of the essentials to ‘recover’ from the hike – a water bottle, tissue pack and a flyer for the Singapore 2015 Launch Party.

“In with the relaxation, and out with the stress. Now that’s Something Worth Celebrating”

“Embrace the sensation of losing calories and stress. Now that’s Something Worth Celebrating.”

**EXTRAORDINARY ART**

**Ordinary Colors Paint An Extraordinary Picture**

Hosted by student radio deejays from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, spectators to the LionsXII match against Terengganu Football Association will be treated to a side-event and create art using paint, darts and footballs.

Don’t worry about getting paint on your clothes, participants will be given ponchos and shoe covers to make as much artistic ‘mess’ as they want.

The final product will be displayed at the Singapore 2015 Launch Party.

This pop-up activation takes place from 6pm and during the half-time of the match.
