<p><strong>Singapore, 7 December 2024 </strong>– Team Nila, Sport Singapore’s
(SportSG) volunteer force, will mark its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary in
2025 with a series of celebratory initiatives. These activities, open to
public participation, aim to recognise the contribution and commitment
of volunteers to Singapore’s sporting landscape over the past decade. The
celebrations kicked off today with Guest-of-Honour Mr Eric Chua, Senior
Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth &amp; Social and
Family Development, announcing the <strong>Team Nila Friendship Band </strong>initiative
at the inaugural Team Nila Volunteer Leaders Retreat.<strong> </strong>This
nationwide initiative encourages Singaporeans to express their appreciation
for Team Nila volunteers’ efforts over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>The Team Nila Friendship Band appreciation initiative, a partnership with
environmental social enterprise <a href="https://www.terra.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Terra Singapore</a>, celebrates and honours
sport volunteers by gifting them upcycled friendship bands. Earlier this
year, SportSG unveiled revitalised uniforms and apparel featuring a lion
emblem. The unique bands are created using pre-loved Team Nila t-shirts
that have been decommissioned.</p>
<p>In recognition of Team Nila’s commitment over the past 10 years, Mr Tan
Hock Leong, Chief of ActiveSG at Sport Singapore, shared: “Over the last
decade, Team Nila’s 50,000-strong volunteer force has been the backbone
of Singapore’s sporting community, contributing over 1.4 million hours
to rally the nation by driving and enabling meaningful sporting experiences
for the community. Team Nila volunteers have been fundamental to the organisation
and running of large-scale local events like the annual Pesta Sukan. They
have also been a constant, energising presence at key sporting events,
galvanising the crowds with Team Nila Beats and cheering on our Team Singapore
athletes at overseas competitions such as the SEA Games. As we enter into
our 10<sup>th</sup> year, we are committed to fostering our volunteers’
growth, enhancing their capabilities and expanding Team Nila’s impact to
reach even more Singaporeans.”</p>
<p>The inaugural Team Nila Volunteers Leaders Retreat also brought together
volunteer leaders among the Team Nila community to brainstorm, celebrate
and look forward to exciting opportunities in the coming year. Coming off
the back of four successful events organised solely by volunteer leaders
at this year’s Pesta Sukan – athletics, bowling, SG Urban Walk and Vertical
Challenge – Team Nila volunteer leaders will continue to spearhead some
of the key events and initiatives in the coming year, as part of Team Nila’s
10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary.</p>
<p><strong><u>Opportunities for Public Participation in Appreciation Initiative</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Members of the public who are interested in making Team Nila friendship
bands can participate in upcoming public workshops, which will be held
at ActiveSG Sport Centres between January and February 2025. More information
will be available on <a href="https://www.activesgcircle.gov.sg/team-nila" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Team Nila’s</a> and
<a href="https://www.activesgcircle.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ActiveSG’s</a>websites and social channels (@activesgcircle and @teamnila)
in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ahead of the initiative’s launch on 7 December, several closed-door
sessions were held for SportSG staff, public agencies and corporate partners
to prepare the first batch of friendship bands. These were then presented
to the volunteer leaders by SPS Eric Chua at the Retreat to mark the launch
of the initiative.</p>
<p>Over 4,000 friendship bands are targeted to be produced across the span
of four months. These will then be distributed to volunteers during the
Team Nila Carnival in March.</p>
<p>To support the initiative from end-to-end, Team Nila volunteers with pre-loved,
decommissioned Team Nila t-shirts are encouraged to drop them off at two
collection points at Terra Singapore and SportSG’s offices. With the t-shirts
comprising a myriad of colours, each friendship band produced will feature
a unique design that cannot be replicated. Members of the public can also
drop off plain white t-shirts, which will be used to add a colour contrast
to the predominantly purple, orange and yellow volunteer t-shirts.</p>
<p><strong><u>Upcoming Celebratory Events in 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Other celebration and recognition initiatives include the <strong>first-ever Team Nila Carnival </strong>and
the <strong>annual Team Nila Awards Ceremony</strong> in March 2025, bringing
together volunteers, key corporate partners, families, and the community
across two events to celebrate the efforts of the volunteers.</p>
