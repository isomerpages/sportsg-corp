Sports tryouts and demonstrations; fun-filled activities; a brand new world-class facility; and an extraordinary occasion. These were among the many reasons that brought over 30,000 people to the day two of the Community Open House at the Singapore Sports Hub today. 

2\. Following a fireworks and laser extravaganza that stole the show on Friday, the festivities resumed the next day with thousands trying their hand at a variety of Southeast Asian (SEA) Games sports including Badminton, Table Tennis, Volleyball and Hockey.

3\. Northland Primary School student Winnie Choo, 12, who travelled all the way from Yishun, saw the open house as an opportunity to check out the new Sports Hub. She said: “I am so excited to be here, and it is great to be a part of the community of Singaporeans who are here to visit the Sports Hub for the first time.”

4\. For 56-year-old Ronald Ng, it brought back fond memories from the past. He said: “Over the years, I have watched countless football matches at the National Stadium. It is nice to have the stadium back. It is so grand and much nicer now, but still retains the flavour and charm of the old stadium.

5\. Families were also treated to a host of fun-filled activities that featured a NILA pop art stand, photo booths, and roving entertainment. Said 29-year-old Human Resource Assistant Nur Hafizah: “Weekends are when I get to spend quality time with my kids. The open house today gave the whole family something to enjoy while keeping fit at the same time.”
