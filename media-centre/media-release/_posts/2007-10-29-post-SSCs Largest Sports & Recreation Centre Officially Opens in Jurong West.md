### **SSC's Largest Sports &amp; Recreation Centre Officially Opens in Jurong West**

**Singapore, 28 October 2007** - Singapore Sports Council (SSC) officially opens Jurong West Sports &amp; Recreational Centre (JWSRC) today. Providing top-notch facilities, it promotes sports participation and healthy lifestyle. Located at 20 Jurong West Street 93, it also sets a stage for family and community bonding among Jurong residents.

Mr S Iswaran, Minister of State for Trade &amp; Industry and Member of Parliament (MP) for West Coast GRC officially opened the $60 million Jurong West SRC with fellow West Coast GRC MPs, Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Arthur Fong. Occupying 23,759 sqm of build-up space, JWSRC is the largest and latest SSC SRC.

The fully integrated sports centre provides a wide variety of sporting facilities such as an Aquatic Centre with one of the few sheltered Olympic-size competition pool in Singapore, SSC's largest state-of-the-art ClubFITT Gym with a special "Ladies Corner", rooftop tennis courts, dance studios, sports hall, a stadium and a variety of retail outlets.

Mr Iswaran also unveiled SSC's first Satellite Sports Museum together with SSC's Hall of Famers. The exhibition will increase awareness and interest in sports, educate Singaporeans about our sports heritage and give recognition to outstanding athletes and sports stakeholders. Young aspiring Singaporeans can also be inspired to achieve sporting excellence from the sporting history.

JWSRC allows residents to engage in sports and leisure activities at their convenience and at affordable rates. Beyond sports programmes, JWSRC also provides comprehensive courses on Cardio, Body &amp; Mind, Martial Arts and even social dance classes. Known as Learn-To-Play (LTP) programmes, courses such as Aqua Aerobics and Cardio Mix are already a hit among Jurong residents.

JWSRC has taken a huge step forward in promoting resident-bonding. It is no longer just a place for sports, but also a place to rest, relax and enjoy. Suki Group is operating 2 eating outlets, Sakura and Ni Hon Mura restaurants, while 7-Eleven will also operate a store within JWSRC. Sports retailer, Sportslink and private dance school, Dancepointe, are also at JWSRC. JWSRC also houses MMI (Montessori) Childcare Centre, making it an all-inclusive SRC serving the community.

JWSRC has also incorporated the family element in its design, with a water slide tower, skim out pool, water play area with themed interactive water sculptures, the lazy river, pool deck with interactive water jets and jacuzzi pool to allow families to have fun together.

"Jurong West SRC goes beyond being a sports facility to a community facility. It sets the direction of Singapore Sports Council in providing top-notch facilities to give residents an all-encompassing experience," said Mr Alex Chan, SSC Chairman.
