Team Singapore athletes visited the 41st Battalion, Singapore Armoured Regiment of the Singapore Armed Forces yesterday, as part of the army unit’s soldiers’ development programme and Total Defence commemoration activities.

2\. Fifteen athletes, who participated in the recent Southeast Asian Games and ASEAN Para Games, took part in a friendly match of Wheelchair Basketball with soldiers of 41 SAR. Among the athletes were Bronze medal Basketball players – Desmond Oh, Ng Han Bin, Russel Low and Jabez Su.

3\. Desmond Oh, captain of the Singapore Basketball team for the 7th SEA Games also had his first try of Wheelchair Basketball today. “I’ve been playing the sport for many years, and this is the first time appreciating it with a twist. The coordination needed to use your arms to move yourself, and to score as well, can be quite a challenge, yet extremely enjoyable at the same time.”

4\. Private Timothy Foong, a 21-year-old full-time national serviceman from Shrike Company, participated in the Silat activities. He said, “This session has taught me several values such as the importance of respecting my opponents, competitors and peers, and these are character traits that can be applied to many aspects of life.”

5\. Other activities for the morning included demonstration of Floorball, sports clinics by judo-ka Ho Han Boon, Gary Chow and Timothy Loh, Silat practitioners Muhammadd Iqbal Abdul Rahman and Muhammad Nur Alfian Juma’en, Boccia players, Neo Kah Whye, and paralympian Nurulasyiqah Bte Mohammad Taha.
