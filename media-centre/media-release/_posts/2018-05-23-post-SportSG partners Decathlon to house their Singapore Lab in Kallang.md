**Singapore 22 May 2018** – Kallang has a natural affinity with sport and adding to its rich sporting history in 2019 will be Decathlon’s most advanced store in Asia. Announced today, the “Decathlon Singapore Lab” will be the first of its kind in Asia. It will be located at Stadium Boulevard and is about 5,000sqm in size.

1. The Decathlon Singapore Lab will aim to use innovation and technologies to bring a unique sporting experience to its users through activation of free to play areas outside the store and testing of products in the extensive experience zones in-store via virtual simulations, augmented reality and etc. Decathlon plans to enhance users’ experience using technology - for example connected fitting rooms, foot scans, mobile payment solutions, including the integration of electronic-wallet capabilities in payment systems allowing sports users to transact and gain rewards through their devices both in stores and through online platforms. Decathlon will also engage with the local community more directly by holding “sports clinics”, fitness programs and other sports events in its stores and free to play areas.

**SportSG-Decathlon MOU**

1. The partnership between SportSG and Decathlon goes beyond the lab. SportSG will also work with Decathlon to help further promote sport, health and wellness to Singaporeans. Mr Lim and Mr Claude signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today that will cover multiple areas including Active Health, ActiveSG Academies and Clubs, and the ActiveSG Sport Centres.

2. Active Health is the national social movement for health and wellness that empowers and motivates individuals to take ownership of their health and well-being. Through the MOU, Active Health Labs will be set-up in selected Decathlon stores where members of the public can learn how to manage their health. There will not only be free programmes for the public to join, but also a wide selection of sports and fitness products to supplement their fitness regime with. Both parties will also leverage on their respective expertise to further the outreach of Active Health and to explore opportunities to do so using technology and e-payment capabilities.

3. Decathlon will also become one of ActiveSG’s partners for the provision of equipment and apparel to ActiveSG Academies and Clubs. The Academies and Clubs initiative was started to make it accessible for anyone to take part in sport regardless of ability or fitness level. There are currently 10 academies and clubs – Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Floorball, Flying Disc, Football, Hockey, Masters, Outdoor Adventure, Tennis. The Academies and Clubs will also tie up with Decathlon to conduct sport-related events such as workshops and roadshows.

4. SportSG will be working with Decathlon to bring ‘Experience’ and ‘Collection’ stores to sports centres around the island. There are also plans to install vending machines in sports centres where sports users will be able to purchase Decathlon products on-the-go.
