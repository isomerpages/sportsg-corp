**Singapore, 25 June 2023** – Hosts Singapore concluded the inaugural Olympic Esports Week on a high with Singaporean Nigel Tan winning the Taekwondo event in the live finals of the Olympic Esports Series 2023. The 14-year-old defeated compatriot Natalie Tor 2-1 in the battle for first place to become Singapore’s first Olympic Esports Series winner on the last day of the event. The other winner on Sunday (25 June) was Kylian Drumont (R8G_Kylian19) from France, who won the Motorsport event. The final day of the Olympic Esports Week 2023 also featured exhibition matches in Arena Games Triathlon powered by Zwift (Duathlon format), Street Fighter 6 and eFIBA on NBA2K. 

Said Nigel: “It was a tough but good fight. It was definitely tiring, we trained quite hard for this and it was super tiring, but it was a good fight. I think Natalie and (third-placed winner) Wu Jingyu did super well also. It feels good that it was an all-Singaporean final and there was so much support. I didn’t expect such a big crowd, I knew there was going to be a big crowd, but I didn’t think it was going to be like packed to the brim. 

“I've definitely thought about (becoming the winner) in my hotel room, I was thinking about it and hoping maybe it could come true. We worked quite hard for this, especially the Refract team who made this all possible in the first place with their system.”
