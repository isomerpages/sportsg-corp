### **Two-Year Ban For Seven Bodybuilding Athletes Who Tested Positive For Prohibited Substances**

**Singapore, 7 August 2012** - Following in-competition testing at the 50th Singapore National Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship 2012 on 1 July 2012, seven out of the eight bodybuilding athletes tested were found positive for banned substances under the 2012 Prohibited List.

2\. Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) notified the athletes that they may have committed a possible Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) on 25 July 2012. The athletes were given the right to request for their B sample to be analysed to confirm the adverse analytical finding from their A sample. However, none of the seven athletes responded by the deadline on 31 July 2012.

3\. The National Anti-Doping Disciplinary Committee (NADC), appointed by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), met yesterday (6 August 2012) to review the cases.

4\. After assessing the cases, the NADC has imposed a two-year ban on each of the seven athletes. They are ineligible to participate, as an athlete or support personnel, in any sport during the period of the ban. They are also disqualified from the 50th National Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championships 2012 and all results, medals, points and prizes attained at the event have been forfeited.

5\. Under the ADS Anti-Doping Rules, the Singapore Bodybuilding & Fitness Federation (SBBF) is required to enforce the sanctions on the seven athletes immediately. The athletes have until 19 August 2012 to submit an appeal to the National Anti-Doping Appeals Committee (NAAC).

6\. Commenting on the incident, Ms Yeo Say Po, General Manager of Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS) said, "Everyone must understand that the use of prohibited substances tarnishes the integrity of sport and its athletes. While sanctions act as a deterrent, equipping athletes with the knowledge and resources to ensure they do not use performance enhancing drugs is critically important. The NSAs must be very serious about anti-doping and put in place systems and processes to educate and assist athletes, officials and sports administrators to ensure the sporting fraternity is drug-free."

7\. The names, event category and the prohibited substances used by the athletes are as follows:

8\. In-competition testing is part of the ADS testing programme to ensure a level playing field for all athletes. Last year, ADS conducted in-competition testing at the National Swimming Championships, the National Age-Group Swimming Championships and the Singapore Track and Field Open. This year, testing was conducted at the Singapore Shooting Open 2012 and the National Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Championship 2012.
