### **Team NILA Ready! Set! Go!**
With 27 days to go to the 28th SEA Games, the Games’ very own Team NILA - comprising 17,000 SEA Games volunteers - is all set for the start of a spectacular Game. As of 4pm, approximately 6,000 volunteers collected their uniform and accreditation passes at the Uniform Distribution & Accreditation Centre (UDAC), since the exercise started on 8 May 2015.

Embodying the values of courage, passion and friendship, Team NILA volunteers have committed their time attending various training sessions organised to get them ready for the Games. Since September, more than 220 training sessions have been organised across all 29 areas of Games Operations.

Volunteers are the hearts behind the Games, and to personally thank and show appreciation for their efforts, Minister Lawrence Wong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, attended the volunteer uniform collection session today, handing out the official 28th SEA Games volunteer uniforms.

Zaher bin Wahab, a Doping Control Officer was one of the Volunteers to collect his accreditation pass from Minister Wong. Mr Zaher said, “We’re only 27 days away now. Volunteers, officials and staff have all worked hard to get to this point - from preparations to training.  Being part of the Games is a huge thrill, and seeing everyone in Team NILA’s purple, pumped up and ready to go is a clear sign that we’re ready”.

Full of excitement and appreciation towards the volunteers, Muhammad Rostam Bin Umar, Chief, Games and Manpower Engagement, SINGSOC Executive Committee said, “It’s been so heartening to see so many Singaporean residents step up to volunteer for the Games.  We want to make this journey meaningful for our volunteers, and something that they’ll remember for the rest of their lives. It’s important that they have fun and Celebrate the Extraordinary, supporting not just Team Singapore, but regional athletes as well.  They will have access to competition venues, so they can watch any sport, at any time, when they’re not on duty, subject to seat availability.”

The UDAC is part of the volunteers’ final stages of preparation for the 28th SEA Games. Located at Level 3 of the F1 Pit Building, volunteers can collect their uniforms from 9am to 9pm tomorrow, 10 May and 10am to 9pm on Monday, 11 May.
