<p><strong>Singapore, 2 SEPTEMBER 2024 </strong>– The inaugural Singapore
Urban Sports + Fitness Festival (SGUSFF) concluded last evening at the
Singapore Expo amidst an array of activities including urban sport tryouts
and a showcase by renowned South Korean dancer and choreographer Bada Lee.
Singapore’s first-ever SGUSFF was launched by Guest-of-Honour Mr Edwin
Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth on 24 August and brought
together over 15 partners from the urban sports and fitness sectors to
curate the inaugural experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Held across two weekends from 23 August to 1 September across six locations
islandwide, over 70,000 participants joined in the festivities that brought
sporting partners and athletes together to showcase exciting sports such
as street dance, fitness racing, parkour, and bouldering, among others
(Refer to Fact Sheet here).</p>
<p></p>
<p>This first-of-its-kind festival served as a platform to rally communities
in support of the growing local urban sports and fitness scenes, with the
aim of boosting engagement and sports participation in Singapore's communities
by capitalising on the growing popularity of urban sports and fitness competitions
among teens and young adults.</p>
