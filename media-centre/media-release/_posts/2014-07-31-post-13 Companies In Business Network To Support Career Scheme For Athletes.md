### **13 Companies In Business Network To Support Career Scheme For Athletes**

_Advisory Panel formed to drive successful implementation of Network_

Six new corporate partners, namely Amore Fitness, Borneo Motors Singapore, DBS Bank, Deloitte Singapore, DHL Supply Chain and Sakae Holdings have joined the Sports Excellence Business (spexBusiness) Network for Athletes today, raising the number to 13 companies since its launch last year.

2\. The spexBusiness Network for Athletes was formed last November to drive the Sports Excellence Career (spexCareer) Scheme, comprising companies from across different industries which will offer career development support to Team Singapore athletes. This support comes in the form of providing internships, apprenticeships, job placements and flexible workplace practices. 

3\. Seven industry leaders have also been named to form the inaugural spexBusiness Advisory Panel by Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Mr Teo Ser Luck. 

4\. Mr Teo unveiled the panel during a networking session for the spexBusiness Network for Athletes at the headquarters of Sport Singapore this afternoon, with 24 companies in attendance. The Advisory Panel, which has been appointed on a two-year term, will be headed by Ms Tan Yen Yen, Regional Vice President & Managing Director, Asia Pacific (South) for SAS Institute. 

5\. The panel’s main role will be to ensure the successful implementation of the spexBusiness Network for Athletes. It will be providing inputs, independent advice, professional knowledge and domain expertise to the High Performance Sports (HPS) Selection and Performance Sub-Committee which Mr Teo chairs, on all matters pertaining to this Network. 

6\. Ms Tan is looking forward to leading the Advisory Panel and said, “It’s my pleasure to work with business leaders who believe in supporting our athletes who have put in plenty of sacrifices and dedication to bring glory to our country. The world of sports is no different from the world of business and we can help to bridge this gap. Collectively, we bring to the table a wealth of experience and connections and we are confident that we can contribute positively as part of Team Singapore.”

7\. Deloitte Singapore is one of the latest on board the spexBusiness Network and they highlighted how they value the attributes often found in high-performing athletes as part of their commitment to continue to support Team Singapore. 

8\. Said Deloitte’s Talent Partner, Ms Seah Gek Choo, “Having employee diversity is an important facet of Deloitte’s talent strategy and we now have access to a wider talent pool through our partnership with Sport Singapore. We also value certain attributes in our people and we find that athletes have all of these and more. High performance is a state of mind, and it translates into the corporate world too – high performing athletes on the whole are able to deliver high level work performance.” 

9\. National badminton player Derek Wong is the latest Team Singapore athlete to be signed on by Deloitte and he has joined as a Research Specialist in their Clients & Markets Department. 

10\. While he has been appointed on a contract basis currently, Deloitte will be offering Wong a full-time role at the firm at the end of his competitive badminton career. 

11\. Said Singapore’s Number 1 shuttler, “I am thankful to Deloitte’s tremendous support and this work opportunity that has allowed me to work flexibly from home around my training and competition schedule. Full-time athletes like myself will be able to continue to give 100% in the sporting field, when we know that companies are extending their arms out so that we will not need to worry about future career plans.”
