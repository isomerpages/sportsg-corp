### **Singapore Launches Invitation to Tender for Sports Hub PPP Project**

The Singapore government today launched the Invitation to Tender (ITT) for the much anticipated Singapore Sports Hub Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) project. The three short-listed consortiums will be required to submit their proposals for one of the world's largest sports infrastructure PPP projects by the end of this year.

The evaluation criteria for the project has been published to guide the consortiums in their bid proposals. The largest weightage will be on the ability of the consortium to attract and host major sports, entertainment and leisure programmes in the Sports Hub. Design and functionality, together with financial and legal strength, will be given equal weightage. Facilities management will also be a factor of consideration in the evaluation.

Commenting on the ITT launch, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports & 2nd Minister for Information Communication and the Arts said: "Today's launch represents a very significant milestone for the Sports Hub's project. This will be an icon of sports, entertainment and lifestyle activities for all Singaporeans. The Sports Hub will also help to position Singapore as a preferred venue for premium sports and entertainment events in the region."

"Various government agencies including the Singapore Sports Council, the Economic Development Board, Singapore Tourism Board and the Urban Redevelopment Authority will work in tandem to ensure its success." added Dr Balakrishnan.

In April this year, The Singapore Sports Council announced that three consortiums vying for the Singapore Sports Hub project had been short-listed. The three consortiums are Alpine Consortium (led by Alpine Mayreder Bau GmbH); Singapore Gold Consortium (led by Macquarie Bank); and Singapore Sports Hub Consortium (led by Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd). The three were short-listed from an initial list of four consortiums, which submitted their pre-qualification documents on 28 February 2006 (Refer to Annex A for the details of the three pre-qualified consortiums).

The pre-qualification stage establishes and pre-qualifies bidders who demonstrate the expertise to execute the project. Potential bidders were pre-qualified based on compliance, eligibility, financial strength and technical ability.

The three short-listed consortiums will now develop and submit their proposals by the end of December 2006. The successful consortium is expected to be selected by March 2007 with financial close planned for August 2007.

The Sports Hub will be a fully integrated sports, entertainment and lifestyle hub for everyone in Singapore. A unique cluster development of world-class sports facilities next to the city, it is the first and largest sports facilities infrastructure Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) project in the world and is also Singapore's flagship and largest PPP project of this nature. The 35-hectare development is conveniently located next to the city and is easily accessible to the rest of Singapore. It will be connected to the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network and major expressways.
