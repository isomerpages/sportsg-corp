### **Kubota Reaffirms its Friendship with the Region with the 28th SEA Games**
Buoyed by corporate support locally and internationally, the Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) today announced a new partner on the team with the inclusion of Japanese major machinery manufacturer, KUBOTA Corporation. Dedicating a cash sponsorship of S$1 million, this represents KUBOTA’s largest support of a sporting event in Southeast Asia.

Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chairman, SINGSOC EXCO, said, “The SEA Games represents a unique opportunity for 11 nations to come together to reinforce our friendship, and corporates see the value in leveraging the Games to connect with their customers across this region. It is even heartening to see friends from outside Southeast Asia come forward to support the 28th SEA Games. The support provided by KUBOTA underpins the spirit of the Games in uniting communities and promoting meaningful co-operation in Southeast Asia and beyond, and this will definitely go a long way to help us Celebrate the Extraordinary.”

Agreeing with the sentiments, Yoshihisa Hosotani, General Manager of Corporate Communication Dept., KUBOTA Corporation added, “We have worked in Southeast Asia for many years and over this period have seen continued collaboration between the diverse people of the region. With the heritage of the SEA Games and that it attracts the attention of over 600 million people, this represents the best platform to support the exchanges and developments in the societies of the region through sport.”

Beyond the SEA Games, KUBOTA also contributes to the local sports community by setting up their own rugby team. ‘KUBOTA Spears’ has been playing in the Japan Rugby Top League since 2003, and KUBOTA regularly holds rugby lessons and rugby festivals on their own fields.

KUBOTA Corporation has been contributing to the mechanisation of agriculture and the improvement of the water and environment in the region. The Group is currently expanding its business in the host country Singapore and also in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and the Philippines.
