### **Let's Play Trailblazer Rolling Into Town**

_Singapore Sports Council's Roving Sports Truck To Make Its Rounds Across The Island In The Lead Up To Singapore 2010_

**Singapore, 21 May 2010** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) will be bringing sporting fun to the heartlands in the lead up to the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games with its new sports truck. Named the 'Trailblazer', the sports truck will be a roving one-stop sports resource centre, offering Singaporeans a wide array of sporting activities including hands-on sports try-outs as well as cheer and sports demonstrations.

2. More than 2000 students at the Methodist Girls' School (MGS) had the privilege of being the first in Singapore to experience what the 20-feet-long 'Trailblazer' had to offer with its collection of portable sports stations and demonstrations. The 'Trailblazer' was unveiled at the MGS this morning by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports. The truck will be making its appearance in shopping malls and at various community events across Singapore over the next four months.

3. A strong supporter of the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, MGS will be cheering for both Team Singapore, and Vietnam - their twinned National Olympic Committee, come August. In addition, MGS students will also be playing their part at the Games as volunteers and will also be a part of the Youth Olympic Games' Culture and Education Programmes. MGS students will also be performing during the Opening and Closing ceremonies for the YOG.

4. "Coming 14 August, we will be hosting the very first Youth Olympic Games in the history of the Olympic Movement. It will be the most significant sports event in Singapore's sporting history to date. We need to feel the pulse of the Olympic Games," said Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO, Singapore Sports Council. "In the spirit of SSC's Let's Play movement, which aims to get Singaporeans to watch, play and cheer for sports, the Trailblazer truck is one of our efforts to reach out to the public and create the excitement of the Youth Olympic Games."

5. Members of the public can look forward to trying out sports such as Table Tennis, Handball, Basketball, Cycling, Football, Hockey, Fencing and Boxing, at the 'Trailblazer's' portable sports stations, which will be set up at each pit-stop. Members of the public can stand a chance to win Let's Play premiums when they try their hands at any of the 'Trailblazer's' eight sports stations. The 'Trailblazer' will also feature demonstrations of Taekwondo, Wushu, Fencing and Boxing.

6. In addition, the 'Trailblazer' will also be a one-stop resource for the public to discover how they can participate in some of the most popular sports in Singapore. The Trailblazer will be disseminating information on Singapore's 24 most popular sports, including Swimming, Netball, Motorsports and Gymnastics.

7. "The Trailblazer will be making stops at various shopping malls, schools, community and sports events around Singapore over the next four months. The Trailblazer will be bringing our Cheer Singapore motivators to familiarise Singaporeans with the new cheer song titled 'You Are The One' and the accompanying choreographed movements. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to not only learn about the various sports, but also to internalise the cheer song and make Singapore's presence felt in every competition venue," said Mr Kelven Tan, Chief of Sports Marketing, Singapore Sports Council.

8. At the same time, Singaporeans can also sign up to be part of the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games Sports Initiation Programme. Managed by the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, the programme offers individuals the opportunity to try some of the sports to be featured at Singapore 2010, including Equestrian, Handball, Rowing and Fencing. These try-outs will be held on non-competition days at the respective sports' competition venues.
