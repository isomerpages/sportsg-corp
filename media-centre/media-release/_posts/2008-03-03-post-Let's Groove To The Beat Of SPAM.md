### **Let's Groove To The Beat Of S.P.A.M!**

Ingenious Movement To Encourage Young Adults To Embrace A Sporting Lifestyle

Singapore, 3 March 2008 - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has launched a new movement in town to encourage all young adults to embrace a sporting lifestyle. Coined as S.P.A.M in short, the Sports Party Animal Movement looks to excite young adults aged 20 to 39 years old that sports can be fun and exciting just like any other lifestyle activity such as clubbing and shopping. In fact, they can use sports to socialise and keep fit at the same time.

2. To mark the debut of the movement, a S.P.A.M party will be held at the popular hangout among young adults, Powerhouse at St James Power Station on 15 March 2008. The sports party promises to be a potent mix of sports and clubbing activities for all.

3. "S.P.A.M is probably one of the coolest things that can exist in sports today. Through it, we aim to drive home the message that sports like many lifestyle activities are great for social bonding. Young people can meet new friends, have a good time and most importantly, keep fit. So make sports a part of your life now and live it up!" said Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer, SSC.

**Highlights At S.P.A.M Bash**<br>

4. Exciting highlights await all at the S.P.A.M bash hosted by ESPN SportsCenter presenter, Steve Dawson, and 91.3FM radio deejays Rod Monteiro and Suzanne Walker. For a start, partygoers can expect a showcase of thrilling sports such as Latino Jam, Muay Thai and Pole Fitness. There will be opportunities to mingle with Team Singapore Sports Idols 2007 such as Jazreel Tan (Bowling), Bryan Tay (Swimming), Tao Yi Jun (Wushu), Kevin Chiak (Bodybuilding), Vanessa Poo Jill (Badminton) and Mohammad Asadullah (Silat) and learn more about sports and the benefits of living up the sporting lifestyle. In addition, there will also be a special fashion segment where the latest chic sportswear will be featured.

5. To raise the temperature further, a Sports Babe & Hunk Search 2008 will see 10 sporty finalists (five male and five female) vie for the titles. They will compete in challenges such as sports games and catwalk segments. The partygoers themselves, together with a panel of judges, will decide the crowning of the winners. The winners will receive a year's membership to California Fitness and other exciting prizes.
