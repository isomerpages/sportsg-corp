Team Singapore is raring to go for the upcoming 32nd Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and 12th ASEAN Para Games (APG) in Cambodia, as it fields a total of 558 athletes across 30 sports in the SEA Games and 26 athletes across six sports in the APG. This will be the first time Cambodia will host the SEA Games and APG.

At the official Flag Presentation Ceremony held at Our Tampines Hub this morning, Team Singapore gymnast Mr Terry Tay and boccia athlete Ms Toh Sze Ning were unveiled as the flag bearers for the SEA Games and APG respectively, while wushu athlete Vera Tan was the pledge taker. 

Guests-of-honour Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, Speaker of Parliament and President of Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, presented the Singapore flags to the Chefs de Mission, who then handed them over to the flag bearers. 

The Royal Torch Relay Ceremony for the 32nd SEA Games and 12th APG was held before the official Flag Presentation at Tampines Central Park where athletes joined His Excellency Mr Hor Sarun, Secretary of State for the Ministry of Tourism and Special Envoy of the Cambodia SEA Games Organising Committee and His Excellency Sok Khoeun, Ambassador of Cambodia to Singapore, to carry the torch into Our Tampines Hub prior to the start of the Flag Presentation. The Royal Torch Relay Ceremony commenced in Cambodia on 20 March 2023 and will travel to the ASEAN countries before returning to Cambodia for the start of the SEA Games. 
 
**2023 SEA Games**
The 32nd SEA Games will feature 36 sports across a few cities including Phnom Penh and Siem Reap in Cambodia from 5 to 17 May 2023. 558 Team Singapore athletes will be competing across 30 sports at the Games.

Dr Hing Siong Chen, Chef de Mission for Team Singapore at the SEA Games, said, “There’s plenty of excitement and enthusiasm from our Team Singapore athletes at this morning’s festivities. We are certain this is the same spirit that our athletes will carry as they compete at the Cambodia SEA Games. Preparations for the Games are in its final phase and we are thankful for the immense support received from the stakeholders. We look forward to a safe and successful outing for Team Singapore in Cambodia.” 

Team Singapore Gymnast and flag bearer for the SEA Games, Terry Tay, said, “Being able to represent Singapore at the major Games has always been special for me - each major Games holds special memories and experiences in my heart. To be able to compete at my 5th SEA Games, and carry the Singapore flag is a true honour. This probably comes as close to one of the best moments in my sporting career. Together with my fellow athletes, I’m looking forward to doing Singapore proud.”


**2023 ASEAN Para Games**
Following the 2023 SEA Games, the 12th APG will be held from 3 to 9 June 2023 in Cambodia, where 26 Team Singapore athletes will compete in six para sports, namely Athletics, Badminton, Boccia, Powerlifting, Swimming and Table Tennis.

Ms Erynne Lim, Chef de Mission for Team Singapore at the APG, said, “I am excited to lead Team Singapore at the ASEAN Para Games, especially since it will be our first time competing at this level in Cambodia. The athletes have put in a lot of hard work and dedication into their training to represent Singapore. I would like to call for all Singaporeans to rally behind our athletes and cheer them on as they do our country proud.

Team Singapore boccia player and flagbearer for APG, Ms Toh Sze Ning, who will be participating in her 5th APG, said, “I feel so inspired by the people who have been working very hard behind the scenes with me. Seeing their hard work and support for me that makes me want to go beyond and strive to do my best at the Games. In this year’s edition, I would like to be able to improve on my previous competition results.”
