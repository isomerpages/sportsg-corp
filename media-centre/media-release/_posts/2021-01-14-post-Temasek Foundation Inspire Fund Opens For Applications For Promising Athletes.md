<h3><strong>Temasek Foundation Inspire Fund Opens For Applications For Promising Athletes</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>$100,000 fund available annually to help aspiring athletes who are not
receiving grants or funding from existing support systems.</p>
<p>Sport Singapore (SportSG) and National Youth Sport Institute (NYSI) will
start accepting applications for the Temasek Foundation Inspire Fund (TFIF)
from tomorrow (13 January 2021) in an effort to support promising athletes
who aspire to represent Singapore at international competitions that may
resume this year.</p>
<p>2. Made possible through the E W Barker Endowment, Temasek Foundation
will contribute $100,000 annually towards the TFIF to provide more opportunities
to athletes who are passionate and committed to sporting excellence, and
to inspire the larger community to discover and pursue their sporting interests.
Jointly administered by SportSG and NYSI, the TFIF provides support to
athletes, who are not supported by the existing grants or funding support.
Potential athletes may apply as an individual or as a team.</p>
<p>3. Mr Edwin Tong, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth &amp; Second
Minister for Law, said, “Athletes who represent Singapore at international
competitions will get a leg up with the new Temasek Foundation Inspire
Fund for Athletes. The fund sets no age limit or restriction on types of
sport, so this will benefit a wider base of aspiring athletes. I would
like to encourage all eligible athletes to apply and make Singapore proud!”</p>
<p>4. There will be two grant calls in a year for the Fund, where up to $50,000
per call will be awarded to shortlisted applicants, and they will be evaluated
based on: (1) the level of competition, (2) the applicant’s or team’s performance
and track record. The application period for the first grant call is from
13 January 2021 to 12 February 2021. The next application period will be
announced in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>5. “At Singapore Sport Institute, we look at every possibility to strengthen
and provide all aspiring athletes with the competitive edge they need to
achieve their dreams. However, this requires the collaborative effort of
every member of our society to contribute as One Team Singapore. We are
pleased that Temasek Foundation has stepped up to join us in enabling athletes
to realise their full potential and hope that the Temasek Foundation Inspire
Fund will encourage more athletes to commit to train, compete at their
best, and inspire our community.” said Mr Toh Boon Yi, Chief of Singapore
Sport Institute, Sport Singapore.</p>
<p>6. Ms Koh Lin-Net, Chief Executive, Temasek Foundation Nurtures, said,
“Aspiring athletes need a community of support to grow. It is so heartening
to see passion-driven, self-funded athletes go on to represent Singapore
in international competitions. They come from different sporting disciplines
– from talented youths in emerging sports such as dodgeball, indoor skydiving
and tchoukball, to Masters athletes. The Temasek Foundation Inspire Fund
will provide support for these athletes to nurture their aspirations. We
hope this will inspire and empower others to follow.”</p>
<p>7. Dr Su Chun Wei, Director, National Youth Sports Institute, said, “The
Temasek Foundation Inspire Fund extends support to athletes who require
financial backing and we would like to encourage youth athletes to apply
for this fund. With NYSI’s focus on the development of youth athletes in
high performance sports, we look forward to supporting more youth athletes
in their sporting aspirations to further build the Singapore youth sports
ecosystem.”</p>
<p>8. While funding levels will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the
qualifying costs taken into consideration can comprise airfare, accommodation,
registration fees, visa fees (if any), and travel insurance (which will
be mandatory for recipients).</p>
<p>9. “One of my challenges is to pay for my overseas competitions. With
BMX competitions resuming internationally, I hope to take part. With this
fund, I hope to get some help and pursue BMX racing as a profession and
represent Singapore in the BMX Asian, Europe and World Championships,”
said Mr Mas Ridzwan bin Muhammad Ali, an 18-year-old BMX rider. Likewise,
Mr Jason Wong who is 54 years old and Asia Masters Athletics Championship
Gold Medalist 100H &amp; 400 H said, “Age is just a number. Achieve our
competitive dreams/goals at any stage of our life. I am looking forward
to apply for this fund in my upcoming competition at Taiwan Masters Track
and Field Championships as it will help to offset competition costs.”</p>
