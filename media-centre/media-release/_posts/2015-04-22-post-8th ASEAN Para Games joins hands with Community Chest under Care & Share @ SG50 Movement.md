### **8th ASEAN Para Games joins hands with Community Chest under Care & Share @ SG50 Movement**
_SAPGOC calls for Corporate Singapore to support the APG_

**Singapore, 22 April 2015** – The Singapore ASEAN Para Games Organising Committee (SAPGOC) will be partnering Community Chest, the fund-raising and engagement arm of National Council of Social Service (NCSS) for the 8th ASEAN Para Games (APG).

2\. SAPGOC will be donating proceeds from the sale of APG merchandise to Community Chest and the amount will matched dollar-for-dollar by the government under the Care & Share Movement. This partnership with Community Chest will be one of many SAPGOC’s initiatives to rally the public, private and people sectors to come together to support the Games and raise funds for schools and organisations that support persons with disabilities.

3\. Mr Lim Teck Yin, Chairman EXCO, SAPGOC, said, “The 8th ASEAN Para Games will be the catalyst for the Care & Share movement to engage the community about the value of sport; inspire them through the spirit and abilities of para athletes and uplift the participation in disability sports. As Community Chest has been doing a wonderful job engaging the people over the years to raise funds for those in need, we are excited to have them as our partner. Through the movement, we hope to create a level playing field for our para athletes to meet their potential.”

4\. Mr Sim Gim Guan, CEO of National Council of Social Service (NCSS) said, “The 8th ASEAN Para Games is a platform where persons with disabilities demonstrate their prowess in the sports arena. It is in the spirit of the Care & Share Movement that we urge more organisations and individuals to show their support. We also encourage members of the public to come together with persons with disabilities at the Games to cheer on the athletes or to volunteer with the APG. Together with the voluntary welfare organisations, we hope to raise awareness on understanding persons with disabilities and celebrating our differences as we build a more inclusive society. We look forward to the display of sportsmanship at the Games and we wish all the athletes success.”

5\. SAPGOC also hopes to clinch S$5 million in sponsorship as it ramps up its preparations for the first APG to be hosted in Singapore. Discussions have already started with members of the business community with the intent of attracting both cash and value-in-kind sponsorships.

6\. “We are also thankful that Corporate Singapore has been considering their support for the APG. There has been promising signs from current discussions and if more eventually come onboard, it will help bring awareness to the para-sports scene and our collective efforts towards a more inclusive society. Finally, we would certainly want the APG to be a fitting wrap to the nation’s jubilee celebration,” added Mr Lim.
