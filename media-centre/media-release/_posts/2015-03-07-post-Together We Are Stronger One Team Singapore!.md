### **Together We Are Stronger, One Team Singapore!**
Orchard Road was turned into a sea of red as Singaporeans turned out in force to show that we are “RED-Y” to cheer our athletes on. As part of the celebration, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, Mr Lawrence Wong led athletes, officials, coaches, volunteers and the community-at-large in a passionate call to support our national athletes as One Team Singapore when they compete against over 5000 of the region’s best athletes in 36 sports come June 5-16 at the 28th Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games).

2\. Minister Lawrence Wong took the opportunity to underscore that everyone is a member of One Team Singapore and that national pride is at stake as our athletes compete on home soil. “In 90 days, we will host the SEA Games – the region’s most iconic sporting event. The spotlight will be on Singapore, so let us all come together as a nation, as One Team Singapore, to give our Team Singapore athletes the boost to reach their best,” he said.

3\. One Team Singapore is also about Singaporeans being the gracious hosts to our guests. EXCO Chairman of Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC), Mr Lim Teck Yin said, “We are the hosts and we should make all our guests – athletes, officials and friends from the Southeast Asian community feel welcomed. So, let’s own the Games and extend the best hospitality to the region. As we cheer for our athletes, remember to encourage other athletes too. After all, we are all friends from the Southeast Asian community.”

**One Team Singapore**

4\. The event at Pedestrian Night at Orchard Road saw the hoisting of the largest ever Team Singapore flag measuring 10 by 7 metres after it was passed along Orchard road by thousands of athletes, volunteers and members of the public. This is also the first time the SEA Games Arch was lit up at the Scotts and will be present till 20th June.

5\. There were also meet and greets with Team Singapore athletes as well as the opportunity to experience some fun sporting activities along Singapore’s iconic shopping belt at the event. The public were given the chance to experience sports such as football, rugby, basketball and badminton right in the middle of Orchard Road.

6\. Team Singapore rhythmic gymnast Tong Kah Mun had the opportunity to perform on stage to the crowd, and she relished the experience, noting “It was heart-warming to see all these people cheer me on in this demonstration as One Team Singapore, and to do it in the heart of orchard road is really amazing! I really feel that such an enthusiastic home ground support will make a significant difference in my performance come June at the SEA Games.”

7\. “Our team is at the last phase of training for SEA Games and today’s event is a timely intervention to remind us that the nation is behind us. I am simply awed and definitely motivated to push further in my preparations so that in June at the SEA Games, everyone will be cheering us with pride,” noted Team Singapore Rugby 7s Captain Daniel Chow.

8\. The One Team Singapore event at the Orchard Road also saw performances from local artistes such as the Sam Willows, Daphne Khoo and Tabitha Nauser, who sang the featured songs: “Ordinary”, “Greatest” and “Unbreakable” from the Games’ official album, Songs of the Games. Produced by Dr Sydney Tan, Music Director for 28th SEA Games, the fully digital album features 14 songs including the three official featured songs of the 28th SEA Games.

**Torch Up! Art Installations**

9\. As part of the 28th SEA Games Torch UP! Programme, a series of 30 Torch Up! Art Installations will be launched in phases from today. These installations are conceptualised by local artists and put together with the help of community groups. Another 20 event-based activities will complement these art installations to make up 50 ground-up Torch Up! projects for the SEA Games.

10\. One of the 3 art installations unveiled today was “Reaching High”, a collaboration between renowned sculptor Mr Sun Yu-li and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). NTU Provost, Professor Freddy Boey said, “NTU is showcasing our expertise in sustainability through art in this sculpture Reaching High, which marries art and technology as part of the 28th SEA Games. An interdisciplinary collaboration with renowned artist Mr Sun Yu-li, the sculpture embodies the spirit of the competition as it portrays the unity of man, technology, and nature working in harmony towards success and a brighter future. Reaching High also highlights the importance and multiple uses of renewable energy, and here we show an example of how it can be used to enhance and add interactivity to art.”

**Reaching out to the region**

11\. To engage the regional community, NILA’s Quest, a web-based digital game specially created for the 28th SEA Games was launched during the event. Featuring the Games mascot, Nila, players will follow him, on a quest to all 11 South East Asian countries to collect flames to contribute to the final SEA Games Torch Up! Art Installation to be unveiled in June. The digital game will also provide players a chance to win one of 15 weekly prize draws. The grand prize will see a winning pair from each country to fly to Singapore to enjoy the SEA Games in Singapore, including the Opening Ceremony. The game is now online at [www.nilaquest.com](http://www.nilaquest.com/).

12\. Breaking new ground was also the SEA Games’ first ever Google+ Hangout, which allowed viewers to interact with Team Singapore athletes past and present, and experience highlights of the event live as they were broadcasted live around the region.
