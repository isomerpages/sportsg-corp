### **SAF SportSG and HPB Promote Fitness and Healthy Living for NSmen**

**SAF, SportSG and HPB Promote Fitness and Healthy Living for NSmen**

1. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Sport Singapore (SportSG) and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) earlier this morning at the ‘Get Active and Celebrate NS50’ Sports Festival at Toa Payoh HDB Hub. Under the MOU, the tripartite partners aim to promote sustainable fitness and a healthy-living culture among Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen).

2. There are plans to introduce initiatives where NSmen will have better access to better their personal fitness, such as SportSG’s sports facilities nationwide, as well as HPB and ActiveSG’s fitness programmes at workplaces and community spaces. Customised team and family-based fitness programmes will also be developed to encourage NSmen to maintain a healthy lifestyle with their friends and family. NSmen can also look forward to enjoy special promotions and privileges for sport facilities and programmes.

3. The MOU signing was witnessed by Chief of Army Major-General (MG) Melvyn Ong, SportSG Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr Lim Teck Yin, and HPB CEO, Mr Zee Yoong Kang. At the ceremony, MG Ong said, “Fit and strong soldiers make for strong units and a strong SAF. This partnership with HPB and SportSG will give our NSmen more fun fitness activities they can undertake on their own time, beyond what the SAF already provides for today. This collaboration will also allow us to design and tailor fitness activities that NSmen can do with their families and friends.” 

4. Mr Zee said, “HPB is excited to work with the SAF and SportSG, in providing greater accessibility and variety of fitness programmes to our NSmen. Tapping on our experience in designing physical activity programmes and the insights we gained from this, we hope to nudge our NSmen to adopt healthier behaviours and enable them to take greater ownership of their health and fitness.” Mr Lim added, “SportSG and the SAF share the aspiration of encouraging our NSmen to keep fit and take ownership of their health. This tripartite MOU synergises the expertise and capabilities of our organisations to enable our NSmen to be fit to defend Singapore, and to benefit their families and themselves for life.”

5. The MOU was signed by Singapore Army's Chief of Staff-General Staff and concurrently Commander Training and Doctrine Command, Brigadier-General Siew Kum Wong, SportSG Deputy CEO, Dr Chiang Hock Woon, and HPB Insights, Innovation and Planning Division Director, Dr Chew Ling.
