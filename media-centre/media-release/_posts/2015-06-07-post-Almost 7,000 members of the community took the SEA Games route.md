### **Almost 7,000 members of the community took the SEA Games route**

Almost 7,000 members of the community participated in the Nila Swim & Aquathlon and Nila Run and events this weekend.

Held on 6 and 7 June, The Nila Swim & Aquathlon and Nila Run, a 10km run events offered sport enthusiasts with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the SEA Games from the athlete’s perspective by swimming and running a modified route of the SEA Games Triathlon Course – a first in SEA Games history.  

After watching the SEA Games athletes complete the Marathon, the community also spent the weekend at the surrounding competition venues, including the Sports Hub.  

Andrew Lio, 32, relationship manager, joined both the Nila Aquathlon and Nila Run. He said: “My favourite moment was when I was running alongside a fellow participant I had just met, and we encouraged each other to push on during the Nila Aquathlon, which really showed the spirit of sport. I also managed to see the SEA Games Triathletes go past on their bikes, which was a big plus.”  

Aileen Ho, 38, who recently completed her 100th marathon, joined the Nila Run, a 10km run which is a far cry from her usual marathon distances. She said, “I was contemplating to join the Phuket Marathon or the Nila Run with my amateur running friends, and eventually decided to be part of the SEA Games in some way. I am happy that I did the run, although we were drenched and cold. We decided to stay and watch. And I am glad I did, because we witnessed our marathon champion doing his home run!"

The Nila Swim & Aquathlon took place on Saturday 6 June with 800 participants, whilst 6,000 participated in the Nila Run on Sunday, 7 June.
