**Singapore, 19 July 2013** - The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has appointed event management and experiential marketing company Spectrum Worldwide Events (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. as the Event Organiser of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS). This follows SSC's Request For Proposal (RFP) published in GeBIZ in March this year.

2. This appointment grants Spectrum the full responsibility of organising the nation's marquee running event. Under the terms of appointment, Spectrum will be expected to deliver four (4) editions of the SCMS, from 2013 to 2016. Spectrum will manage all aspects of the event, including existing relationships with sponsors, opportunities for other commercial tie-ups to enhance the participant experience, marketing, operations and logistics. Spectrum will also be responsible for ensuring the event's growth, in consultation with the SSC. SSC will continue to be the Event Owner and will maintain strategic oversight. SSC will provide a grant (based on SSC's event funding framework) in the initial years to help defray the cost of loss-leading elements of the event. The grant will be based on agreed plans for each edition of the event.

3.  "We are pleased to have appointed Spectrum Worldwide as the Event Organiser for the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore for the next four editions. We assessed three proposals thoroughly and Spectrum's comprehensive approach and long term ideas for SCMS have impressed us. Their proposals are much aligned with our Vision 2030 goal of reaching out to the community to live better through sports," said Mr. Toh Boon Yi, SSC's Chief of Strategic Development and Marketing Group and Vice-Chairman of the SCMS Organising Committee. "We have full confidence that Spectrum will have the capabilities to further build on and expand on the successes of previous editions, and will work closely with them to ensure that our participants are provided the best race experience possible."

4. Spectrum has a comprehensive track record in managing mass participation sporting events in the region. They were involved with the organisation of past editions of the SCMS, and had demonstrated keen understanding of the complexities of organising an event of such scale.

5. This year's SCMS is scheduled to take place on 1 December 2013. To date, 34,709 runners have registered for the event.
