<p><strong>Singapore, 31 July 2023 </strong>– Eight of Singapore’s most promising
young football talents – six girls and two boys – will study and train
abroad full-time under the first overseas scholarship by national football
project Unleash the Roar! (UTR!). The UTR! project is a long-term roadmap
to uplift our football ecosystem and rally the nation behind our shared
aspirations for Singapore football.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The UTR! Overseas Scholarship recipients will be heading to two of the
world’s top institutions for developing young football talents. Five will
be attending the IMG Academy’s programme in Florida, United States of America
(USA), and three will be enrolling at ESC LaLiga &amp; NBA in Madrid, Spain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IMG has produced world stars such as AC Milan’s Christian Pulisic, the
USA women’s national football team’s Mallory Swanson, and goalkeeper Bryane
Heaberlin who last played with Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany’s top tier
football league Bundesliga. ESC LaLiga &amp; NBA, the academy project of
Spain’s top-tier league LaLiga, has hosted top prospects from around the
world, including Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr Eric Chua, Chairman of the UTR! Executive Committee and Senior Parliamentary
Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth, &amp; Social and Family Development
said, “The UTR!<em> </em>Overseas Scholarship marks a significant milestone
for Singapore football. It provides our finest talents the opportunity
to study, train, play and compete overseas – full-time on a multi-year
basis – under robust football development programmes offered at reputable
institutions such as the IMG Academy and ESC LaLiga &amp; NBA. Through
this, we hope that our young talents will hone their skills, inspire others
to pursue their sporting aspirations, and fly our Singapore flag high.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Close to 150 guests including parents, football administrators, ex-internationals
and family members of the scholarship recipients were present at the UTR!
Overseas Scholarship award ceremony today. Minister for Culture, Community
and Youth &amp; Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong presented the scholarships
to the eight recipients.</p>

<p><strong><u>UTR! Overseas Scholarship recipients chosen through robust selection process</u></strong>

The eight UTR! Overseas Scholarship recipients – Ardhra Arul Ganeswaran,
Chloe Koh, Irsalina Irwan, Kyra Taylor, Loo Kai Sheng, Seri Ayu Natasha
Naszri, Uchenna Eziakor, and Yasmine Zaharin (refer to <a href="/files/Media Centre/Media Release/2023 &amp; 2024/Jul_2023___ANNEX_A___Profiles_of_Recipients_of_the_Inaugural_UTR__Overseas_Scholarship.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Annex A</a> for
profiles) – represent the best talents of their cohort. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The scholarship recipients were endorsed by a selection panel led by UTR!
Executive Committee’s Chairman Mr Eric Chua following a robust selection
process. This process began with an initial shortlist of close to 40 male
and female student athletes, based on the preliminary assessments from
the Football Association of Singapore and Singapore Sports School. These
players were then observed during training sessions and competitions by
a technical committee led by FAS Technical Director Mr Michael Browne,
whose members assessed their footballing abilities and potential. From
this, a smaller group of players were invited to an in-person panel interview
with representatives of the UTR! Executive Committee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of the scholarship recipients is 17 years old Singapore Sports School
student Loo Kai Sheng, who trains and plays with the Singapore Under-17s
and the Young Lions Under-21s. Kai Sheng said, “I am so happy and thankful
to be given this opportunity. This scholarship is a high honour and will
help me realise my fullest potential. I am determined to adapt quickly
and learn from the best coaches and like-minded players in Spain and from
other countries. My goal is to become a professional footballer and play
for Singapore.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another recipient, 16 years old Irsalina Irwan, who has already earned
five caps with the Singapore Women’s National Team, said, “The feeling
of being given this opportunity to study and train overseas is just as
surreal as my first call up to the Women’s National Team. The thought of
two to three football training and physical conditioning sessions daily
over the next few years with top professionals in the US excites me, and
I cannot wait to start and do my very best. I want to learn as much as
possible and be a better defender.”</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Holistic support throughout scholarship journey</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scholarship
recipients can look forward to receiving holistic support from both their
respective overseas institutions and the UTR! network throughout their
scholarship journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ESC LaLiga
&amp; NBA and IMG Academy offer conducive training environments with the
integration of sports science, a high-quality competition schedule throughout
the year, and suitable academic options that offer flexibility and support
future academic aspirations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scholarship
recipients will also receive the support of the UTR! network back home
in Singapore, through mentors comprising football administrators and ex-internationals
such as former Lions Aide Iskandar and Goh Tat Chuan as well as Lioness
Fazila A. Latiff. The mentors will have regular check-ins with the student
athletes during their scholarship journey to provide guidance and motivation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On supporting
his daughter Ardhra’s move to USA, Mr Arul Ganeswaran said, “It is indeed
a bold decision by the family, but we said yes because we know Ardhra can
do it. Her character and attitude will serve her well to be disciplined
in her training and academics. Also, we feel assured about the support
system, safety and administration at IMG Academy. We are excited to see
how her experience at IMG can develop her further.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking about
this significant opportunity for budding youth footballers, ex-Lions and
former captain Aide Iskandar said, “When I was around their age, I too
had stints overseas. Players like Rafi Ali and I benefitted from the international
exposure because we were pushed beyond our comfort zones to train hard
and excel. This is a wonderful start and future growth of youth development
for Singapore football. As a mentor, I hope to encourage them and let them
know that I am within reach should they need to discuss their progress,
or even just to talk. I am honoured to be a part of this programme and
look forward to supporting our footballers throughout their scholarship
journey.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon their return,
the scholarship recipients will contribute back to the Singapore football
ecosystem, including representing Singapore in international competitions.</p>
