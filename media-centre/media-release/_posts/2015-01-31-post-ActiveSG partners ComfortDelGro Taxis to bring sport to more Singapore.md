### **ActiveSG partners ComfortDelGro Taxis to bring sport to more Singapore**

From next month onwards, some 37,000 taxi drivers will stand to enjoy free admission to all ActiveSG gyms and swimming pools every Wednesday for the rest of the year, as ComfortDelGro Taxis enters into a partnership with the national movement for sport.

2. The collaboration will see ActiveSG working closely with ComfortDelGro Taxis to not only enhance access to its facilities, but also educate taxi drivers on the range of sporting activities available and how they can lead a more active lifestyle. For instance, taxi drivers will be kept apprised of programmes offered at ActiveSG through channels that are familiar to them – such as the training hub, service centres, driver portals and district committees. ActiveSG will also run bi-monthly workshops in smaller groups at convenient locations, where the taxi drivers can learn light exercises and engage in topics relating to health and fitness. In addition, both parties will work closely with each other to organise sporting programmes as well as promote and facilitate sport interest groups among the taxi drivers.

3. Said Mr Yang Ban Seng, CEO of ComfortDelGro (Taxi Business), “Given the sedentary nature of their job and the hours our drivers put on the roads, the welfare and health of our taxi drivers has always been one of our main concerns. Therefore, we are happy to collaborate with ActiveSG to encourage our drivers to keep fit and healthy. This partnership complements our health checks and health coaching sessions that we conducted for our taxi drivers last year. ”

4. Said ActiveSG Chief Mr Lai Chin Kwang, “We are excited to have ComfortDelGro Taxis partner us in promoting awareness of more sporting opportunities, especially given its extensive network.  This collaboration marks the start of an important journey – one that will help taxi drivers lead a more active lifestyle amid their erratic work schedules, and in turn become role models who can inspire their passengers and the larger community to stay active. We look forward to working with more like-minded organisations in extending our reach to enable more to live better through sport.”

5. This partnership marks a step forward for ActiveSG, as it continues to engage companies in sport. Upcoming plans in this regard include the ActiveSG Corporate Membership Programme, which will be formally introduced to companies in the later part of this year.
