<h3><strong>'LIVE LIFE, BREATHE SPORTS'</strong> - <strong><em>Sporting Culture Committee Releases Its Recommendations</em></strong></h3>
<p>The Sporting Culture Committee (SCC) released its report today, detailing
23 recommendations to catalyse the growth of an inclusive sporting community,
groom our own sporting heroes to bring home international glory, and develop
a dynamic sports industry that generates economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Formed in September 2006 by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth
and Sports (MCYS), the SCC is chaired by Parliamentary Secretary Teo Ser
Luck. Mr Teo and his fellow committee members, who hail from the people,
public and private sectors, share a passion for sports and a strong belief
about the benefits of sports to the individual, community and nation. The
list of committee members is available at Annex A.</p>
<p>Said Mr Teo, "After many months of brainstorming by the members of the
Sporting Culture Committee, as well as consultation with various groups
and stakeholders from within and outside the sporting fraternity, I am
pleased to share the Committee's report with the public. I believe this
report is an important step towards nurturing a sporting culture in Singapore."</p>
<p>The Committee's recommendations emphasise providing sports opportunities
for all - the young, working adults, families, seniors and the disabled
- and ensuring engaging experiences for active sports participants, spectators
and even volunteers. The recommendations include the formation of a National
Sports Strategy Committee for Sports to oversee the implementation of the
SCC's recommendations, initiating the inclusive multi-sports Singapore
Games, supporting the development of sports clubs, and creating more playing
spaces in the heartlands.</p>
<p>Mr Teo added, "The Committee members strongly believe that sports has
the power to galvanise people. Sports is fun and allows families, friends
and neighbours to bond in an emotive and experiential manner when they
play and watch sporting events together. The Committee hopes that everyone
will come onboard and work together to build an enduring Singapore Sporting
Culture."</p>
<p>The Sporting Culture Committee has submitted its report to MCYS. The Ministry
will study the recommendations and give its response during the Committee
of Supply sessions in March.</p>
<p>Issued by The Ministry Of Community Development, Youth and Sports.</p>
