**Singapore, 9 September 2012** - After nine days of excitement filled Game days, the first-ever national multi-sport event, Singapore National Games (SNG), closed to an exuberant crowd comprising community athletes, volunteers, game officials, participants and members of the public at a Closing Ceremony held this evening at Bishan Stadium. The event, officiated by President Tony Tan Keng Yam, highlighted the friendships that were built between athletes and communities during the inaugural SNG.

2. Held from 1 to 9 September 2012, the inaugural SNG brought together more than 5,000 community athletes, officials and volunteers who played an integral role in making the Games a success. Singapore residents also turned out and cheered on their family members, friends and neighbours as spectators and cheerleaders at venues across the island.

3. "We would like to thank all the community athletes, supporters, participants, volunteers and sponsors for their help in making the first-ever SNG such a roaring success. We encourage more people to step out and be part of our next SNG and we look forward to welcoming you all in 2014," said Minister Lim Swee Say, Deputy Chairman of People's Association (PA).

4. The high-spirited crowd at Bishan Stadium was treated to a video montage of the Games' highlights over the last nine days. President Tony Tan, who was officiating the event, also presented the Sports Challenge Shield to the top three clusters, which recognised the top three clusters for their sports performance and their community athletes' exemplary participation in the Games. First place winner, Chua Chu Kang, also walked away with the Sports Challenge Trophy.

5. In addition, the Community Challenge Shield was also announced and presented at the Closing Ceremony to the top three clusters for their exemplary engagement efforts to bond residents in the Community Games and the SNG. Clusters were judged for how well they decorated their competition venues, excellence in cheerleading groups to enliven the Games and how well they had reached out to involve their residents as supporters for their clusters' teams during the Games, as well as their volunteers' active involvement to contribute to making the Games a success.

6. Commenting on the Games, Mr Lim Teck Yin, Co-Chairman of the SNG Organising Committee and Chief Executive Officer of Singapore Sports Council (SSC) remarked: "We are really delighted by the community's participation in the SNG. People from different walks of life came out as athletes, officials and volunteers to make this a truly memorable experience for all involved. With the experience of this inaugural Games, we hope to make the 2014 edition even better and look forward to seeing all our participants again and new ones too."

7. Mr Yam Ah Mee, Co-Chairman of the SNG Organising Committee and Chief Executive Director of PA, agreed: "We are very heartened to see the community coming together to support their athletes at all the venues for the 10 participating sports. Their enthusiasm and passion cheering on the community athletes, and the camaraderie among the athletes that we had witnessed during the Games, show that the SNG is a perfect platform to forge the bond within the community."

8. Over the nine Game days, a total of 212 gold medals were presented, with Ang Mo Kio leading the medal tally with 34 gold, 16 silver and 16 bronze medals. Following closely behind is Chua Chu Kang with a total number of 68 medals (30 gold, 22 silver and 16 bronze) and Bishan-Toa Payoh with a total number of 45 medals (19 gold, 14 silver and 12 bronze).

9. Expressing his delight of being part of the inaugural SNG, Mr Hong Wei Jian, Captain of Jurong Green, Basketball team from Jurong Cluster and former Singapore Slingers, commented: "The standard for SNG was quite high, thus I feel that it allowed everyone, not just national athletes, to have a feel of a spirited competition. Also, I feel that the organisers had done a really good job. The set-up and logistics were great. They even sent me a reminder SMS to come for the game; I was really impressed. I believe SNG will continue to grow and I look forward to participating in future Games."

10. Mr Poon Choong Meng, Badminton player for Toa Payoh East CSC, Bishan - Toa Payoh Cluster agreed: "Our members have been playing together for years and jumped at the opportunity to participate together as a team for the SNG. It has since become a community gathering for us and we have become great friends."

11. The SNG is jointly organised by the SSC, the PA and its grassroots organisations, the community sports clubs, as well as the National Sports Associations of the 10 participating sports, namely Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Dragon Boat, Football, Netball, Sepak Takraw, Swimming and Table Tennis.

**Annex C: Fact Sheet on SNG**
<br>
The Singapore National Games 2012 (SNG) is a new biennial multi-sports festival that bridges community participation and sports excellence, and will offer residents of all ages, races and from different estates the opportunity to be part of Singapore's exciting sporting landscape. From the Sunday sports enthusiast, the arm-chair commentator, to the serious athlete, all can now play, compete, support and volunteer.

The inaugural SNG saw community teams pitting against each other in ten sports. The SNG was jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), People's Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations, the Community Sports Clubs, as well as the National Sports Associations (NSAs) of the ten sports. It aims to be a meaningful and memorable sporting festival that ignites passion, builds character, and connects people and bonds Singaporeans.

The Community Games (CG), which is organised annually, will serve as the qualifying round for the SNG in the years when it is held. For 2012, CG was held from April to July and the SNG was held from 1 to 9 September.

The ten sports featured in 2012 were: Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Dragon Boat, Football, Netball, Sepak Takraw, Swimming and Table Tennis. To bring the competitions to the heart of the community, the 2012 Games was held at various venues around Singapore, including Sports & Recreation Centres, Community Clubs, schools, the Bedok Reservoir and the Singapore Sports School. Teams were formed according to geographical clusters. Winners were each awarded a medal, with trophies being awarded to the winning teams.

Participation was opened to Singapore Citizens as well as non-Citizens, including Singapore Permanent Residents. National athletes were also eligible to compete. However in general, National athletes and non-citizens made up at most 20% of the team size, or one member of the team, whichever was higher. In order to encourage wide participation from all age groups and races, as well as residents living in both public and private estates, team composition for all sports had been formulated through discussion with the respective NSAs. With various team mix requirements, it was intended that more enthusiasts with different abilities would be able to be part of this nation-wide competition.

Earlier this year, close to 10,000 residents took part in the annual Community Games, which served as the qualifying round for seven out of the 10 participating sports for the SNG in the years when it is held. More than 300 teams made up of Singaporeans, permanent residents and expatriates who reside in Singapore had qualified to compete in the Games. From 1 to 9 September, we saw more than 5,000 community athletes competing in the SNG.
