### **Sports Hub Consortiums Beef Up Teams In Lead Up To Bid Submissions Deadline**

The three consortiums short-listed for the Singapore Sports Hub Project have beefed up their consortium teams in an effort to strengthen their proposals leading up to the bid submission deadline on 28 February 2007.

The consortiums have added new partners who will provide expertise in the areas of event programming and management, retail management, design, construction, legal and finance, and facilities management.

Oon Jin Teik, CEO of the Singapore Sports Council, said, "As we approach the final stretch of the Invitation To Tender (ITT) for the Singapore Sports Hub, I am pleased to see the consortiums bringing on new partners and expert advice. Over the last few months, the consortiums have taken the project brief, digested it and understood very clearly our project objectives. This addition of new consortium partners signals their recognition of the areas of importance to focus and to put up the best proposals that will meet our vision for the Sports Hub."

**Bids will be evaluated on four criteria:**

* Financial and legal appeal (25%)
* Facilities management (10%)

Added Oon: "Forty percent of the evaluation will focus on the strength of the consortiums' proposal to bring in sports, entertainment and leisure programmes to the Sports Hub that will fill up the calendar on event and non-event days alike. Functionality and design will cover 25 percent, as will financial and legal appeal. The aim is to find long term funding plans and financial models, which deliver value for money solutions. Ten percent of the evaluation will focus on facilities management. While each individual criteria is important, we are looking for proposals that are able to closely interlink all four areas to provide a total solution that best meets the project's objectives."
