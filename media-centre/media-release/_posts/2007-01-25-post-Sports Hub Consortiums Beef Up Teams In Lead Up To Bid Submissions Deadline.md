### **Sports Hub Consortiums Beef Up Teams In Lead Up To Bid Submissions Deadline**

The three consortiums short-listed for the Singapore Sports Hub Project have beefed up their consortium teams in an effort to strengthen their proposals leading up to the bid submission deadline on 28 February 2007.

The consortiums have added new partners who will provide expertise in the areas of event programming and management, retail management, design, construction, legal and finance, and facilities management.

Oon Jin Teik, CEO of the Singapore Sports Council, said, "As we approach the final stretch of the Invitation To Tender (ITT) for the Singapore Sports Hub, I am pleased to see the consortiums bringing on new partners and expert advice. Over the last few months, the consortiums have taken the project brief, digested it and understood very clearly our project objectives. This addition of new consortium partners signals their recognition of the areas of importance to focus and to put up the best proposals that will meet our vision for the Sports Hub."

**New Partners**<br>

**The consortiums have added the following new partners:**
* Alpine Consortium (led by Alpine Mayreder Bau GmbH/ Alpine Bau Deutscheland AG/ AFP)
* Tim Hupe Architects Germany (Lead architect/ master planner)
* Squire Mech Pte Ltd (M&amp;E engineer)
* Dalkia (Facility management)
* Alpine, Babcock &amp; Brown and Great Eastern (Funding partner)
* Ashurst International Lawyers (Legal advisor)
* The Singapore Gold consortium (led by Macquire Group)
* John Laing Infrastructure Ltd (Funding partner)
* Freehills (Legal advisor)

* The Singapore Sports Hub Consortium (led by Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd)
* CICADA (Landscape architect)
* DHI Water and Environment (Environmental consultant)
* Duffill Watts (Traffic consultant)
* Faithful &amp; Gould (Technical advisor)
* Global Spectrum (Comcast Spectator - PICO - Venue management, Event programming and marketing)
* World Sport Group (Event promoter)
* ARM (Sport consultant)
* Knight Frank (Retail/ Commercial advisor)
* Ernst &amp; Young (Taxes advisor)
* Rajah &amp; Tann (Legal advisor)
* Norton Rose (PPP legal advisor)

**Bids will be evaluated on four criteria:**
* Appeal of sports, leisure and entertainment programming (40%)
* Functionality and quality design (25%)
* Financial and legal appeal (25%)
* Facilities management (10%)

Added Oon: "Forty percent of the evaluation will focus on the strength of the consortiums' proposal to bring in sports, entertainment and leisure programmes to the Sports Hub that will fill up the calendar on event and non-event days alike. Functionality and design will cover 25 percent, as will financial and legal appeal. The aim is to find long term funding plans and financial models, which deliver value for money solutions. Ten percent of the evaluation will focus on facilities management. While each individual criteria is important, we are looking for proposals that are able to closely interlink all four areas to provide a total solution that best meets the project's objectives."
