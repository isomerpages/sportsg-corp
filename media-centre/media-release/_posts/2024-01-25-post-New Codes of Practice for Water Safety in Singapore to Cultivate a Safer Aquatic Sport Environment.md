<p><strong>Joint Media Release between Sport Singapore and the Singapore Standards Council </strong>
<br>
<br>The newly launched Aquatic Facilities and Inland and Open Water Sporting
Activities guidelines outline best practices among popular water sports.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore, 25 January 2024 </strong>– Sport Singapore (SportSG)
and the Singapore Standards Council (SSC), which is overseen by Enterprise
Singapore (EnterpriseSG), have set out more robust guidelines for safer
aquatic sporting environments in response to the rising popularity of aquatic
sports. Organisations vested in aquatic sports and fitness, and those managing
aquatic facilities, are encouraged to adopt the new guidelines to support
and enhance aquatic sport safety standards.</p>
<p>The launch of the new guidelines under the Singapore Standard (SS) 700:2023
Code of Practice for Water Safety – Aquatic Facilities and SS 701:2023
Code of Practice for Inland and Open Water Sporting Activities, was graced
by Mr Eric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Culture,
Community and Youth &amp; Ministry of Social and Family Development. Industry
stakeholders including representatives from SportSG, Enterprise Singapore,
schools and Institutions of Higher Learning, event organisers, National
Sports Associations, and other government agencies were also in attendance.</p>
<p>The newly launched Singapore Standards were developed by Working Groups
comprising representatives from the public and private sectors, and through
public consultation to gather feedback from the industry. Appointed by
the Singapore Standards Council, the Working Groups advised on the guidelines,
and ensured that the recommendations were tailored to effectively address
the risks associated with sporting activities at aquatic facilities as
well as in inland and open waters.</p>
<p>They also build on earlier standards<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> developed by SportSG and the Singapore Standards Council.
The SS 700:2023 Code of Practice for Water Safety – Aquatic Facilities
is updated with additional safety considerations for shallow water blackouts
and prolonged breath-holding, while the SS 701:2023 Code of Practice for
Inland and Open Water Sporting Activities set out requirements for users
to exercise safety practices and precautions, particularly pertaining to
water safety requirements for common inland and open water sporting activities
in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chief of ActiveSG, Sport Singapore, Mr Tan Hock Leong said, “We see a
growing demand for aquatic sports among Singaporeans, hence it is imperative
to uphold stringent levels of safety. Our new COPs are designed to help
improve our understanding of water safety while engaging in aquatic sports.”</p>
<p>“Whether you are an event organiser, a coach of a school or club, the
COPs allow one to effectively evaluate the known risks of aquatic sporting
activities and help mitigate them. The necessary safe practices in place
will provide ease of mind and encourage more to participate in aquatic
sports,” added Mr Tan.</p>
<p>Ms. Choy Sauw Kook, Director-General (Quality and Excellence), Enterprise
Singapore, said, “The safety of our athletes and members of the public
is of paramount importance. The launch of SS 700: 2023 and SS 701:2023
reiterate our continued commitment to work with key stakeholders and experts,
allowing us to identify best practices and develop this series of water
sports safety standards. We encourage all aquatics facilities as well as
sport activity organisers and participants to adopt these standards and
create a safe aquatics environment for all.”</p>

<p><strong><u>Deployment of SS 700:2023 Code of Practice for Water Safety – Aquatic Facilities</u></strong>
<br>The new SS 700:2023 outlines general guidelines for the prevention of
drowning and injuries at aquatic facilities in Singapore. It provides requirements
and recommendations for stakeholders to address any health and safety concerns
during the use of aquatic facilities, thereby preventing injuries and drowning
incidents. The SS 700:2023 will be available for purchase on the Singapore
Standards e-Shop.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Deployment of SS 701:2023 Code of Practice for Inland and Open Water Sporting Activities </u></strong>
<br>The new SS 701:2023 outlines water safety guidelines for recreational,
competitive, and educational activities planned by public and organised
groups in inland and open waters. It provides requirements and recommendations
for stakeholders to address any health and safety concerns during the use
of open water locations and during organised activities in an open water
environment, thereby preventing injuries and fatalities. It is important
for stakeholders and the public to work together to help strengthen health
and safety practices for activities in open waters. The SS 701:2023 will
be available for purchase on the Singapore Standards e-Shop.</p>
<p>The goal of the new Singapore Standards is to foster a safety-first culture
where stakeholders proactively and collectively play their part in improving
and ensuring water safety. Stakeholders can acquire greater understanding
of the risks associated with aquatic sporting activities at aquatic facilities
and in inland and open waters, thereby improving future risk planning and
risk management leading to safer water sport participation for everyone.
Organisations can use the new standards to build on their existing water
safety protocols or to establish new ones.
