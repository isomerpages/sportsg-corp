### **Final Preparations For The Inaugural Asian Youth Games On Track, As Shared With Sports Fraternity**

**Singapore, 12 May 2009** - With less than 50 days to the 1st Asian Youth Games (AYG) Singapore 2009, the Singapore Asian Youth Games Organising Committee (SAYGOC) shared its final preparations for the Games with the local sports fraternity at the Singapore Sports Council's (SSC) 2nd Singapore Sports Networking Session 2009 this evening.

2. Details shared at the Session include the unveiling of the medal design for the 455 AYG medals. The medal epitomises the spirit of the Games with the AYG logo as its centrepiece, underscoring the Olympic values of 'Excellence, Respect and Friendship', embossed down the side of the champion's ribbon. The reverse side of the medal has the AYG mascot, FRASIA, to symbolise the friendships forged through the Games, as well as an orchid - our national symbol to represent Singapore as the host nation.

3. "Often, the most memorable highlights in an athlete's career are the moments of clinching coveted medals at a competition. Each medal that an athlete wins represents a milestone in his or her career. I am sure that the medals will be treasured by the recipients for years to come, and will be a constant reminder of the emotional experiences and moments derived from, and shared at the inaugural AYG," said Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and Ministry of Transport.

4. School Adopts a Sport Venue, an AYG initiative which will see local schools adopting different AYG sports venues, was also announced this evening. The programme will see the participation of 14 schools and more than 900 student and teacher volunteers. Volunteers will assist sports officials in various Front of House and Field of Play functions such as access control, scoring, pitch preparations and as announcers for the events. 19 schools, including six offering training venues, were presented with certificates of appreciation for their invaluable contribution to the AYG.

5. Commenting on the School Adopts a Sport Venue initiative, Mr Oon Jin Teik, the Co-Chair of SAYGOC and CEO of SSC said: "As the AYG is a Games for the youth, it is important for the local youth to be equally involved in the event, be it as a volunteer, supporter or spectator. Under the School Adopts a Sport Venue initiative, students will play an important role in supporting the venue managers to ensure that the sports events run smoothly. This opportunity will also provide them with invaluable experience of being a part of the inaugural AYG, and, at the same time, help in character-building and the development of skills that can be used in their future sporting endeavours."

6. The evening also saw the engagement of 10 AYG Venue Managers. An official ceremony was held during the event, during which the Venue Managers received their official appointment letters from SAYGOC. As the main coordinator at their respective venues, the Venue Managers will play a critical role in ensuring that the various supporting functions are well integrated to deliver the highest service level to all AYG participants and supporters.

7. Moving into the final phase of the Games preparations, Mr Oon said: "The AYG will be a proud moment for Singapore and the sporting fraternity. With the 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009 just around the corner, we want everyone to come together to support this venture and make it a milestone, for Singapore, and a poignant legacy for the community."

8. The 2nd Singapore Sports Networking Session is one of many platforms the SSC has introduced to facilitate open communication with stakeholders and partners within the sporting fraternity. The SSC sees these dialogue sessions as an important networking tool to assist in their vision of developing sports in Singapore and making sports a way of life for all for the larger community

**About the 1st Asian Youth Games Singapore 2009**<br>
The Asian Youth Games (AYG) is an international multi-sports event held every four years to complement the existing Asian Games. The idea was first mooted as part of Singapore's Youth Olympic Games bid in 2007. On 3 April 2008, the Olympic Council of Asia?s (OCA) Executive Board unanimously agreed to award the hosting of the first AYG to Singapore. This decision was backed by all 45 members of the OCA on 6 April 2008. The inaugural AYG, which is co-organised by the Singapore Sports Council and the Ministry of Education, aims to gather the youth from around Asia in a celebration of youth, sports and learning, where they will engage in friendly competition and imbibe the Olympic sporting values of excellence, friendship and respect. AYG Singapore 2009 will see athletes aged between 14 and 17 from 45 OCA member nations competing in 90 events across nine sports from 29 June to 7 July 2009.
