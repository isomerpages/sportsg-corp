### **Reply to Forum Letter in The Straits Times: "Complicated process to get ActiveSG benefits"**

We refer to the letter, “Complicated process to get ActiveSG benefits”.

ActiveSG was conceived to encourage Singaporeans from all walks of life – regardless of age, skill level, or physical ability – to lead an active lifestyle through sport. With this in mind, we strive to make sport easily accessible to all, whether it is in terms of proximity, affordability or performing transactions. 

There are multiple channels available for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) to sign up as an ActiveSG member, utilise their benefits and book our facilities. These include our smart phone applications, the internet, as well as at our Guest Services Offices at all our ActiveSG Sports Centres. 

In addition, ActiveSG utilises a convenient ‘cardless’ system which ties a member’s account to one’s NRIC. This allows members to perform transactions in person by simply producing their NRIC; Senior Citizens concession card; PAssion card; or other forms of identification over the counter at any of our ActiveSG sports centres and swimming complexes.

While we have designed our processes to be as user-friendly as possible, members who require assistance are free to approach our Guest Services Officers at any of our ActiveSG Sports Centres. Meanwhile, members of the public are welcomed to submit their feedback and suggestions at [sport_qsm@sport.gov.sg](mailto:sport_qsm@sport.gov.sg), as we always continue to explore ways to enhance the quality of our members’ experience.
