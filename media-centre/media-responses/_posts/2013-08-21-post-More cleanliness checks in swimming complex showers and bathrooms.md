### **Reply To Forum Letter In Lianhe Zaobao: "Poor Hygiene Standards At Bedok Swimming Complex"**

*In response to a Forum Letter in Lianhe Zaobao ("Poor hygiene standards at Bedok Swimming Complex", 20 August 2013):*

We refer to Mr Lim Xiang Ming’s letter dated 20 August 2013.   
  
We apologise for the lapse in our cleaning services. We have since instructed our contractor to thoroughly clean the shower cubicle highlighted by Mr Lim.   
  
In addition, our staff will also increase the frequency of checks in our toilets and bathrooms to ensure that they are clean and safe for public use.    
  
We appreciate Mr Lim’s feedback and look forward to his continued patronage of our sports facilities.
