We may speak a different language,  
our watch may tell a different time,  
and we may sing to a different tune.

But what unites us is our shared aspiration for our region  
– our home.

And no matter where home may be,  
we are all connected through our individual journeys;  
to find our own extraordinary, be it big, or small.

A groundsman working round the clock to ready the pitch.  
A fan raising an extra decibel to will on her team.  
An athlete sacrificing years to shave off a second.

Whoever we are or wherever we’re heading,  
one thing always remains the same;  
that success ultimately comes  
to ordinary people with extraordinary dreams.

Celebrate the extraordinary.
