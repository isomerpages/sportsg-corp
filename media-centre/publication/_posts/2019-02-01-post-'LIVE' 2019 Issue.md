### **'LIVE' 2019 Issue - Giving Back!**
Sport not only has the power to engender national pride, build a sense of identity or strengthen social cohesion, it also offers a platform to showcase our spirit of volunteerism and genuine care for one another.

In this edition, 'Giving Back', we share the stories of ordinary people who have activated sport as a force for good and make Singapore a better place.
