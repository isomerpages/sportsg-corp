In the **Stronger, Together** issue, we highlight some of the partnerships and relationships that in 2016 reminded us of how much good we can do when we work together. The people in these pages have inspired our Singapore spirit, with their resilience, tenacity and willingness to lend a hand and work together. 

  

Just as Sport Singapore believes in the power of sport to help people live better, we believe that we can do more, aim higher and go farther through collaboration. With the start of the new fiscal year, we look forward to new partnerships and new reasons to celebrate who we are as Singaporeans.
