### **'LIVE' 2017 Issue - Spirit: Why We Do What We Do**

Since **Vision 2030** was published in 2012, we have seen change take root in our society - from community-driven programmes to high performance sport. In this edition, 'Spirit: Why We Do What We Do', we take a closer look at why people enrich their lives – and the lives of others - through sport.

The people in the pages of this issue embody the Singapore spirit through their tenacity, resilience, and care for others. Some may be familiar to you as they are medal winners, while others, especially those that serve behind the scenes – coaches, officials, volunteer photographers, student athletes and parents, will be new to you. In their different ways, they all believe in the power of sport.
