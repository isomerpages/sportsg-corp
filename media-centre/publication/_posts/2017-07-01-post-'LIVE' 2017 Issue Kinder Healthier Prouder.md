### **'LIVE' 2017 Issue - Kinder, Healthier, Prouder**
Since Vision 2030 was published in 2012, Singaporeans have begun to change the way we lead our lives through our involvement in sport. As individuals, communities and a nation, we are living better through sport.

The cover story of this issue of LIVE highlights how sport has been used for social good, from teaching kindness to empowering the vulnerable. We also look at different programmes and pathways created by SportSG to help shape the health of all Singaporeans, from our academies and clubs to our newest intiative Active Health. Not only will our children and youth build their physical literacy through our sport academies, their parents and grandparents can learn how to keep fit and stay active through our clubs and Active Health. We also talk about how sport fuels our national pride through events that bring a diverse range of people together, from the recently completed 29th SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur to the upcoming 9th ASEAN Para Games in September.

As we change through Vision 2030, we have much to celebrate throughout 2017. **Happy 52nd Birthday, Singapore.**
