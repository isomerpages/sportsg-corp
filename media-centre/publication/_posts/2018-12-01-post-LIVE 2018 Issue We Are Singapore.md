### **'LIVE' 2018 Issue - We Are Singapore!**

In this edition, **'WE ARE SINGAPORE!'**, we take a closer look at how sport:

*   inspired our people through our athletes’ journey at the 2018 Asian Games,
*   ignited our passion as we stood behind our favourite teams during the 2018 World Cup and the 2018 International Champions Cup,
*   brought us together as one in celebration of our nation’s 53rd birthday celebrations through Sport Singapore’s annual signature event, GetActive! Singapore.

This issue also marks a milestone in Sport Singapore’s journey as we pay tribute to Mr Richard Seow, who has helmed the board of Sport Singapore from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2018 and welcome on board our new Chairman, Mr Kon Yin Tong.
