### **'LIVE' 2018 Issue - City Alive!**
Singaporeans have witnessed how our liveable city has transformed vastly through the decades. The infrastructure cannot be ignored. However, there has been an emergence of "sportware" that enlivens our landscape; that brings our people together across the spaces to play and build lasting friendship; that enables us to embrace and use our urban landscape to have fun, and to cultivate emotive bonds that inspire the Spirit of Singapore.

In this edition, **"City Alive! Sport bringing life to our busy city",** we take a closer look at how sport has enriched the lives of Singaporeans, forms a more cohesive community and how our "sportware"has been a force for good in our society and city.
