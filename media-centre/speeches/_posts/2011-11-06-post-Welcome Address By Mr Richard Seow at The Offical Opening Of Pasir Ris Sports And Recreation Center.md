Ladies and gentlemen

1 Good morning and a very warm welcome to the official opening of Pasir Ris Sports and Recreation Centre (SRC). I would like to take this opportunity to wish all my Malay friends present a Selamat Hari Raya Haji.

2 I'm delighted that all of you could join us here today to share in the launch of our 21st SRC.

3 Over the years, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has been working diligently to build innovative spaces to develop a true sporting culture for all in Singapore. By driving an integrated strategy for sports excellence, participation and industry, we want to see more people playing and embracing sport.

4 The vibrant integration of sports and recreational facilities offered at the Pasir Ris SRC, represent SSC's dedication to provide an all-inclusive sports and lifestyle experience. Our commitment to build new and enhanced facilities and programmes complemented with retail and lifestyle spaces has been well-received by Singaporeans.

5 To illustrate this point, allow me to quote a letter from a member of the public, Mr. Chandra Das, which was recently published in The Straits Times on 30 September 2011:

"I compliment the Singapore Sports Council on their excellent set-up and running of their ClubFITT facilities. As a member, I have noticed the gyms' usage by a wide range of people of all age groups and races. Well done, and Kudos to staff like Wan, who make it a breeze for all to enjoy being fit and healthy."

6 Mr Das' letter is a tribute not just to the diverse offerings at our facilities, but also to the efficiency and sincerity of our service staff and SSC's commitment to service excellence.

7 As we adapt to the future needs and demands of our changing landscape, the Pasir Ris SRC has been created specifically to provide a platform for all sporting appetites. Some of our comprehensive facilities include a swimming complex with water play features and a Jacuzzi, a gymnasium with a view of the pool, an air-conditioned indoor sports hall with seating capacity for 2,000 spectators, a 5-a-side soccer court and two outdoor tennis courts.

8 The Pasir Ris SRC also features a variety of lifestyle amenities ranging from sporting apparel shops and F&B outlets, to a child education centre and a 24-hour convenience store.

9 Over the years, Singaporeans have become more aware of the importance to reduce our carbon footprint. Based on the recent Asian Green City index, Singapore has been billed as Asia's greenest metropolis. I am happy to report that the Pasir Ris SRC reinforces Singapore's status as a green city. It is the first SRC designed to give guests the feeling of being in a 'green' sporting sanctuary in the middle of the town centre.

10 This SRC is designed with environmentally friendly and energy-saving features such as a rainwater-harvesting system to irrigate surrounding plants, vertical 'green' walls and landscaping to reduce ambient heat and solar panels for energy generation.

11 Through the spaces at our facilities, SSC aims to bring communities together through sport. Sport brings balance, and it enriches lives. It is all-inclusive and, most important, it leaves no man behind. The Pasir Ris SRC has been built to an optimum level of accessibility, whether you move with the agility of youth or the more measured step of a senior citizen.

12 As you make your way around the facility, you will observe the Braille markings and tactile warning strips to guide the visually impaired. The lap pool has a specially designed ramp for wheelchair users and slip-resistant tiles are used at the pool decks and for all wet areas. For guests who have difficulties climbing the stairs, a passenger lift is also provided for their convenience.

13 Special toilets and showers for wheelchair users, the disabled and children are amply provided in this SRC. Nursing rooms, diaper-changing stations, toddler seats and grab bars have also been incorporated into the restrooms.

14 Our team of dedicated and well-trained SSC staff is committed to provide the best sporting experience to our guests. To ensure the highest safety standards at our sports facilities, our lifeguards are trained in lifesaving skills, including CPR, AED and First Aid.

15 The transformation you see before you today has evolved through years of consultation with various grassroots and other government agencies. Recently, SSC has embarked on a new initiative called Vision 2030, with the aim of creating a new sports master plan for the next 20 years.

16 In alignment with Vision 2030, a new 20-year Sports Facilities Master Plan is also being created, with input gathered from Singaporeans across the board. We are committed to building spaces for our communities to live, play and bond. We are currently at the feedback phase, and I urge you to get involved in the conversation. Log onto our website: [www.vision2030.sg](https://www.vision2030.sg). Together, we can realise our shared future for Sporting Singapore.

17 Moving forward, I'm confident that the diversity of sporting space will inspire you to embrace sport as part of your life. I hope that the Pasir Ris SRC will not only enrich your lives through sport, but become a place where families and residents gather to form life-long bonds of friendship.

18 I wish you a very sporty Sunday.
