Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,

A very good evening.

1 On behalf of the Singapore National Olympic Council and the Singapore Sports Council, I extend a very warm welcome and thanks to all of you for attending the Singapore Sports Awards 2011. In this hall tonight, we have gathered some of the biggest sporting talents and stars in our country. They are our dedicated sportsmen and sportswomen who have made many sacrifices for the love of their sport and for the glory and pride to represent Singapore.

2 We have 60 awards to present tonight - to some very special and deserving sports personalities. The selection committee had a very tough time and had to deliberate long and hard this year due to the high calibre of submissions.

3 Tonight we will celebrate our World Champions, the Asian, Commonwealth and National Champions and record holders. They have all made enormous contributions that have helped developed Singapore sports to what it is today. Their hard work and unfaltering perseverance to constantly strive to be the best they can be, and to reach the Peak of Perfection have put our small country on the international sports map. The Singapore Sports Awards is our way of honouring them and thanking them for everything they have done for sports in Singapore.

4 Most of them are working very hard in preparation for the 26th SEA Games this year. As Chef-de-Mission I look forward to working with those selected athletes as we seek to do our very best for Singapore at the 26th SEA Games in Palembang, Indonesia this November.

5 Tonight we would also like to salute the pillars of support that make up the foundation of Singapore sports. I would like to thank our dedicated Coaches, Sports Officials, Administrators and Volunteers from the NSAs, SSC, SNOC and MCYS; all agencies who have helped to create a conducive environment for sports to flourish; our generous Sponsors, Family Members, and Media friends. Thank you all.

6 Finally, I would thank our Guest-of-Honour, DPM Teo, and Major-Gen Chan Chun Sing for gracing this special occasion, I also wish to express my deep appreciation to members of the Organising Committee for your tireless work behind-the-scenes to make this year's Awards Ceremony a success.
