Ladies and gentlemen

Boys and girls

A very good afternoon to all of you.

2 I am honoured to be here for the National Cheerleading Championships. I was told that two years ago, the Singapore Sports Council introduced 'Cheer Singapore' to show our support for our athletes and teams competing at the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games. From the energy and atmosphere we experienced today, it is clear that our cheerleaders have kept up the momentum. I would like to commend all the participants for your dedication and for captivating us with your exciting performances.

3 The National Cheerleading Championships is about celebrating the joy and excitement of cheering together as a team, and collectively as a community. Through cheering, we can also promote community bonding where friends and families come together to support their local sporting icons and teams. The Community Games and the Singapore National Games will be taking place over the coming months. Do invite your families, friends and neighbours to cheer on the participants and be part of the exciting atmosphere at the Games.

Thank you.
