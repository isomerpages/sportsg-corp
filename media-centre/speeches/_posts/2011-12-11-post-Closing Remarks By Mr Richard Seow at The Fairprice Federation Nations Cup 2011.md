### **Closing Remarks By Mr Richard Seow, Chairman Of Singapore Sports Council At The Fairprice Federation Nations Cup 2011**

CLOSING REMARKS BY MR RICHARD SEOW, CHAIRMAN OF SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL AT THE FAIRPRICE FOUNDATION NATIONS CUP 2011
SUNDAY, 11 DECEMBER 2011 AT 6.25 PM TOA PAYOH SPORTS HALL

Mr Tan Wee Khim, President of Netball Singapore,

Mr Cyrus Medora, Executive Director of Netball Singapore,

Coaches, staff and players of the Fairprice Foundation Nations Cup,

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

1 It has been a wonderful week of netball.

2 I want to congratulate and thank the winners and runner-up for playing their hearts out and entertaining us with a thriller of a final.

3 My congratulations and thanks also go to the organizing committee, sponsors, volunteers and all who have made this competition possible.

4 We define ourselves in the games that we play and how we play them. Today on the court we have witnessed athleticism, fitness, teamwork, leadership, resilience, grace, competitiveness, passion and a fighting spirit.

5 Sport and in particular netball is a worthy measure of how we define ourselves. This was clearly evidenced by how the game was played today. Well done Team FIJI and Team Singapore.

6 The past week has been thrilling and entertaining for netball fans in Singapore and overseas. The fans by their presence and avid support bring out that something extra from the competitors and spur them to greater heights. But as fans the competition provides us with thrills, inspiration and enjoyment.

7 With a growing sports calendar here in Singapore we hope to get more spectators to make a family event out of going to watch netball and other sports - to cheer and stand united behind your favorite team.

8 Sporting events like the Nations Cup are important to Singapore. They inspire our sporting spirit: our personal resilience, our community bonds and our national pride. And, yes, there are many reasons for us to be proud: the National Team, the fans, the 80,000 girls who play netball in school, the coaches, the sports organisers, the volunteers who give their time and energy, and the officials. In fact, I'm pleased to note that four of the eight umpires selected by IFNA for this year?s Nations Cup were from Singapore.

9 So, congratulations to Netball Singapore for hosting an excellent Nations Cup. Thank you as well to title sponsor NTUC Fairprice Foundation and main sponsors UOB and Energizer for their great support of the 6th Fairprice Foundation Nations Cup. Let's do it again next year. Thank You.
