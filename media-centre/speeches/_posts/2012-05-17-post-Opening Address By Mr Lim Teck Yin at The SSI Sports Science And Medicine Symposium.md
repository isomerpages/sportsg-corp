_Opening Address by Mr Lim Teck Yin, Ceo of Singapore Sports Council, at the SSI Sports Science and Medicine Symposium_

_Thursday, 17 May 2012, 0845am at Concorde Hotel_

Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

A very good morning.

1. Let me begin by extending a very warm welcome to all our international guests. On behalf of the Singapore Sports Council, we are delighted to be hosting this symposium. I am also pleased to see so many from our local sporting fraternity here today.

2. This symposium is the first time that Singapore has hosted such a wide representation of sports science and medicine professionals and administrators from the various sports institutes in the region. I know that everyone here today is in the final stage of preparing their national athletes for the London 2012 Olympic Games. So, I would like to thank all of you, for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend this inaugural symposium in Singapore.

3. We have with us today the sporting powerhouses of China, Japan and South Korea, who have led the way in putting Asian athletes on the podiums at Olympics Games. Aspiring nations Hong Kong and Malaysia are also in attendance as are our friends from New Zealand. In a few moments, Dr David Rowlands will do us the honour of kicking off today's symposium.

4. Although we are at different stages of our sporting development, we all believe in the power of science and partnerships to realise our aspirations. In business, collaboration even among competitors is a common theme in the modern world to improve profitability. In the sporting arena, collaboration reflects the true spirit of sport: to bridge divides, to unite nations and to grow together in the spirit of goodwill and friendship.

5. With change being the only constant in today's rapidly evolving world, it is sometimes challenging to keep up with the latest research and developments in the many areas of sports science and sports medicine.

6. Today's symposium provides the platform to explore different perspectives and models for sporting excellence. It gives us a chance to keep up with the latest trends and leverage on our strengths. It opens the possibility to forge new partnerships. While we each support different teams who are competitors in the sporting arena, collectively, we are anchored on the same principles, purpose and passion.

7. Later today the Singapore Sports Institute will be signing memorandums with the sport science institutes from China, Hong Kong Korea and Malaysia. Even though we stand behind teams on opposite sides of the court, the true spirit of sport shines through when we come together as a professional community to share knowledge and ideas, and to learn from each other. Working together, we collectively raise the bar of international sports competition and events hosting.

8. I'm confident that as we continue with our conversations, we will forge deeper, more meaningful bonds of friendship. I also would like to thank this year's organising committee for your dedication and hard work. I wish all of you an enriching two days ahead.

9. Thank you.
