1. Good morning. I am happy to see so many special guests from the community to officially open The Rink at JCube. This is Singapore Sports Council's (SSC) first ice skating rink. We have some exciting action planned, including a presentation ceremony for the first graduates of The Rink's Learn-to-Skate Programme.

2. Today marks a milestone in the development of sporting space in Singapore. Inspired by the concept of "placemaking", The Rink was deliberately located at JCube Mall so it could be part of our social lives. It also shows how effectively the public and private sector can work together to make Singapore a better place in which to live, work and play.

3. SSC can take the lead to create sporting opportunities for all, but collaborations with companies such as CapitaMalls Asia are essential to the development of Sporting Singapore. Through our joint efforts, the rink is being operated as a non-profit facility for community play and recreation. This has been made possible through the Community/Sports Facilities Scheme (CSFS) from the Urban Redevelopment Authority.

4. We have with us today eight enthusiastic skaters who are eager to show us the fundamental skills they have acquired through the Learn-to-Skate Programme. They are among the 500 people who have signed up for lessons at the rink. Our first pair of skaters, Mavis (15) and Valerie (8), are performing the Forward Dips & Two Foot Jumps.

5. Our next pair of skaters, Nicholas (51) and Augustine (9), are demonstrating the Snowplow Stop & Backward Sculling, as I speak. I think Nicholas and Augustine are proof positive that you can learn to skate at any age, whether you are young or young at heart.

6. Next up, we have Tiffany (10) and Bryon (11), who are performing the Left Foot & Right Foot Glide.

7. Last but not least, here's Melody (9) and Xuan Xuan (12), with their Crossovers. These are among the many foundational moves that new skaters must learn before they progress further in their course.

8. These skaters have been learning the sport for less than four months. Our next skater, 16 year-old Yi Ching has been skating since she was four years old, and she is an example of what can be achieved after many years of disciplined training.

9. Like all sport, ice skating is a journey. It can take place over many years and lead to many pathways, from figure skating to speed skating to playing on an ice hockey team. The Rink is an opportunity for Singaporeans to try new sports in the heart of Jurong.

10. We are here today because we all believe in the power of sport to improve lives. SSC has been fortunate to have the support of visionary partners such as CapitaMalls Asia and the Urban Redevelopment Authority. So, come every week, come every day. Time on the ice will make you fitter and healthier. Most important, you will be able to make new friendships and enrich old ones while enjoying sport at The Rink.

11. Live Better Through Sports. Thank you.
