### **Welcome Address By Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO, Singapore Sports Council, At The Memorandum Of Understanding Signing Between SSC And The Korean Foundation For The Next Generation Of Sports Talent**

WELCOME ADDRESS BY MR LIM TECK YIN, CEO, SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL, AT THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SIGNING BETWEEN SSC AND THE KOREA FOUNDATION FOR THE NEXT GENERATION SPORTS TALENT
FRIDAY, 30 MARCH 2012, 4.15PM AT GOLD ROOM

Dr Chung Tong Gu, Chairman of Korea Foundation for the Next Generation Sports Talent (NEST)  
  
Distinguished Guests,  
  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
  
A very good afternoon.  
  
1 It gives me great pleasure to welcome our friends from the Korea Foundation for the Next Generation Sports Talent (NEST). In the past two years, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has engaged in several positive visits and exchanges with our counterparts from the Republic of Korea. Today's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) solidifies our commitment to build on this glowing relationship to grow and learn from each other.  
  
2 When I visited NEST in September last year, I was deeply impressed by the systems and programmes put in place to identify and develop the future generation of sporting talents and leaders.  
  
3 The Korean Sports model has achieved great success in the international sporting arena, setting a benchmark that Sporting Singapore aspires to emulate. From the time that the decision was made to host the Olympics Games in Seoul 1988, the Republic of Korea has gone on to produce numerous world champions in a variety of sports and disciplines.  
  
4 I'm confident that Sporting Singapore will benefit immensely from this partnership. SSC is also pleased to welcome our counterparts from the Republic of Korea with the opportunity to extend their capabilities with more hands-on learning experiences in Singapore.  
  
5 In many respects, our partnership today comes at a pivotal time in our sporting journey. When we launched Vision 2030, we established that sport has an integral part to play in our future. Sport instils lifelong values in our youth; it helps bring balance to our lives and enables our seniors to age actively. Through the achievements of our athletes, sport unites us and enhances our sense of national identity.  
  
6 And although podium finishes often take the limelight, we know that sporting excellence results from a strong sporting ecosystem. We can see this with complete clarity in the NEST sport development model.  
  
7 With its emphasis on identifying and developing future generations of sports talent, the NEST aligns well with our aspirations for our young athletes under the Vision 2030 mantle. Like NEST, we also are committed to improving the professional qualities of our sporting talents, leaders, administrators, officials and coaches through Vision 2030.  
  
8 I want to thank the Korea Foundation for the Next Generation Sports Talent for embarking on this journey with us. As we grow and learn together, we also forge a closer a bond within the sporting community. I'm confident this partnership will benefit both parties as we seek to expand the opportunities for our people to grow, to develop and live better through sports.  
  
9 Thank you
