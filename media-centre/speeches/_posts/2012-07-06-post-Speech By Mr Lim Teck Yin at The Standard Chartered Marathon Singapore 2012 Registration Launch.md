### **Welcome Speech By Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO, Singapore Sports Council At The Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2012 Registration Launch**

Mr Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports,

Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, Singapore Sports Council

Mr Ray Ferguson, Chief Executive Officer, Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore

Distinguished Guests,

Friends of the media,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

A very good afternoon and a warm welcome to all of you to this year's registration launch of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore (SCMS) 2012.

2. It is inspiring to see so many people here today. I am delighted to see the passion that people have for running and indeed for the SCMS. I applaud your commitment and I'm sure many people will be inspired by you to live a more sporting and active lifestyle.

3. Last year, the SCMS received the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Gold Label certification, ranking us amongst the top races in the world, alongside the likes of Boston, New York, Tokyo and London. Not only does the Gold Label enhance our position as the place for sport in Asia, it is a testament to the commitment and capability of our people. I would like to thank all the staff, volunteers, sponsors, our fellow government agencies and participants. Together, we have placed Sporting Singapore on the world map once again.

4. Over the years, the SCMS has captured the hearts of runners across Singapore. We call it the People's Race, because it continues to bond communities and bring people from all walks of life together, through sport. In our recently concluded look at the value of sport for Singapore, Vision 2030 registered the importance of compelling sporting events for people wanting to enjoy leisure time with family and friends.

5. However Singaporeans are increasingly running the marathon to support a good cause. Runners can raise funds for their charity of choice through the "Run for Good" charity programme via Give.sg. Last year, 312 runners raised a total of over S$230,000 which benefited some 52 charities. We deeply appreciate their spirit of giving as we begin the holiday season. We hope that more runners and corporate organisations will take part this year to further encourage and grow the culture of social activism through sports in Singapore.

6. Seven runners from diverse backgrounds are here to share their common love of running and their reasons for running SCMS. One of them is 70 year-old veteran runner, Mr Chan Chan Seng, who only started running at 50 years old. He is living proof that it is never too late to start a new sport. Another SCMS 'evangelista' is Sky Khoo, who has been influencing and encouraging friends to run. He has also attained his coaching certification and now trains runners professionally.

7. Every year, we make improvements to ensure the SCMS continues to be an enjoyable race. For this year's event, the total number of runners will be capped at 60,000. After reviewing the races of the past few years, we decided that this number would be an ideal size to ensure a smoother and safer race for everyone. Five race categories - the Full Marathon, Ekiden relay, Half Marathon, 10km race, and Kids Dash are open for registration, so do sign up as soon as possible as they fill up fast.

8. Many different stakeholders and sponsors contribute to the success of the SCMS. I would like to thank Standard Chartered Bank for their unwavering support over the years. A special mention must also go to our fellow government agencies, the Land Traffic Authority and the Traffic Police for ensuring a world-class race day experience for our runners. We would also like to thank all our stakeholders, sponsors, partners and volunteers for your continued support.

9. To all our runners, I salute your commitment and I wish you well in your upcoming preparations. See you at the start line on 2nd December 2012.

10. Thank you.
