CLOSING REMARKS BY MR RICHARD SEOW, CHAIRMAN, SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL, AT THE ISPS HANDA SINGAPORE CLASSIC 2012
SUNDAY, 8 APRIL 2012, 3.45PM AT THE ORCHID COUNTRY CLUB

Dr. Haruhisa Handa, Chairman of the International Sport Promotion Society (ISPS),

Mr Kyi Hla Han, Executive Chairman, Asian Tour,

Mr M Murugiah, President, Singapore Professional Golfers' Association (SPGA),

Mr Chong Kee Hiong, President, Orchid Country Club (OCC),

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Members of the media,

Good afternoon a very Happy Easter Sunday

1 It gives me great pleasure to join all of you at the ISPS Handa Singapore Classic 2012. Over the past four days, you have captured the imagination of golfing fans in Singapore and those watching around the world, through the Asian Tour's global television platform. I would like to congratulate Australia's Scott Hend for displaying great composure to clinch the title.

2 This year, over 40 champions, with more than 100 victories among them, took to the greens. I'm pleased to note that the ISPS Handa Singapore Classic 2012 comprises more local professional and amateur golfers than any other golfing tournament on the Sporting Singapore calendar. The event has been an excellent opportunity for Singapore's aspiring talents. In total, some 30 local golfers were given the chance to compete with some of the best from Asia.

3 The Asian Tour is to be commended for creating more platforms for our golfers to improve their game. I would like to thank Dr. Handa and the International Sport Promotion Society for your support of this event over the past three years. It is inspiring that a businessman from Japan supports sport in Singapore.

4 I am also delighted to see Dr Handa's use of sport to help people of all abilities to live more meaningful lives. At SSC, we also believe in using sport as a force for social good. Through Vision 2030, our blueprint for sports for the next two decades, we are setting up a 'SportCares Foundation and Movement'. SportCares will use sport to help empower the more vulnerable in our society.

5 As an event anchored on providing more opportunities to pursue our sporting aspirations, the ISPS Handa Singapore Classic best exemplifies the power of sport to bring people of all abilities together in the spirit of goodwill and healthy competition.

6 Finally, I would like to thank the SPGA and the Asian Tour for organising yet another successful ISPS Handa Singapore Classic 2012. A special mention must also go to the Orchid Country Club for your hospitality, not just over the past four days, but for the past three editions.

9 Thank you.
