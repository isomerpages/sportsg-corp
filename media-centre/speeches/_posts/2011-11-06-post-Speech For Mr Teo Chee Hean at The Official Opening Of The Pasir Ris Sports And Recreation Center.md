**Introduction**
1 A very good morning to all of you. Let me first wish all Malay friends who are here with us today, "Selamat Hari Raya Haji."

2 It gives me great pleasure to be here at the official opening of the Pasir Ris Sports and Recreation Centre (or SRC for short).

3 Sports play an important role in our community. The spaces we share through sport provide a common ground for us to come together. Sports also provide excellent opportunities for everyone to participate, watch, unite and celebrate as one people, regardless of race, language, religion or age.

4 For youths, playing sports can help to develop life-long values such as teamwork, fair play and the importance of hard work. As working adults, sports can help to bring balance to our increasingly busy lives. As we get older, sports provide a platform for senior citizens to remain socially, mentally and physically active. And taking part in sports activities helps families to bond by playing together.

**Active Living in Pasir Ris**

5 Over the years, Pasir Ris has grown into an attractive and vibrant location for active people. Pasir Ris Park is a hotspot for water sports, cycling and in-skating enthusiasts. The Children's Playground continues to entice our younger adventurers with attractive features like the giant space-nets, cableways and innovative play stations. Pasir Ris Beach continues to welcome runners, cyclists and families from around the island, especially on weekends.

6 Just in front of us, Pasir Ris Town Park has emerged as the preferred location for many residents to start their day, exercising on the reflexology footpath, or at the fitness corners and stations.
The large marine pond is also a popular haunt for anglers looking for their next big catch. Residents of Pasir Ris have long wanted a Sports and Recreation Centre to complement the various other facilities that we have here in Pasir Ris. I am really delighted that this wish has now been fulfilled. On the many occasions that I've been at the Sports and Recreation Centre since it opened its doors, I am glad to see that the facilities are well-used. The many happy faces each time I come, are testimony to how well appreciated this facility is by our residents of all ages.

7 I am also glad that the design of this Sports and Recreation Centre has been a collaborative effort. I would like to thank the officers from the Singapore Sports Council and the other government agencies, for working together with our grassroots leaders and residents to take in their suggestions and observations, to make the SRC fit in with the needs of the community. This included the final location of the Sports and Recreation Centre, the sports facilities that are most in demand, how to interface the Centre with other facilities to make it more welcoming to the community, and the design of the traffic flow to facilitate entry and exit from the Centre.
This has given our grassroots leaders and residents a great sense of participation and ownership in the building of this SRC. So, thank you SSC, for your open, consultative and receptive style of work.

8 With the new facilities available at Pasir Ris Sports and Recreation Centre, we now have an additional venue for residents to interact and bond with one another in our community. Over the years, SRCs have evolved to meet changing needs and allow more people to enjoy the benefits of sports. The SRC of today is a vibrant, one-stop community venue, and not just a place to exercise.

9 Dad can hit the gym, while mum can attend fitness courses at the dance studio. The kids can have fun at the water slides while grandma and grandpa can enjoy a leisurely dip in the jacuzzi. Thereafter, the whole family can dine at the many food & beverage outlets available at the SRC. Indeed, there is something for everyone here.

10 Before its official launch today, Pasir Ris SRC had already opened its doors to community events such as the One Community Walk, Pasir Ris and Punggol PCF Sports Meets, and an outdoor movie screening for the little ones on Children?s Day. I am happy to see that Pasir Ris SRC has already brought people together, and enhanced cultural and social interaction among residents.

11 I would also like to take this opportunity to say a few words in support of our Team Singapore athletes. We are just five days away from the 26th SEA Games in Indonesia. Our athletes have been training very hard and I am sure they will do their best to make Singapore proud. Through the Singapore Sports Council's well-wishers' campaign, many people have been sending in their good wishes to Team Singapore. You can also share your Singapore Spirit with our athletes at the Let's Play Non-Stop Road Show at the foyer. Let's show Team Singapore that our nation is firmly behind them as they go into competition!

12 Finally, I encourage all of you to come and check out the community spaces, the sports facilities and the exciting range of activities offered at the new Pasir Ris SRC. With your active participation, I am confident that Pasir Ris SRC will develop into a thriving community hub which will help strengthen our bonds as friends and neighbours.

13 Thank you.
