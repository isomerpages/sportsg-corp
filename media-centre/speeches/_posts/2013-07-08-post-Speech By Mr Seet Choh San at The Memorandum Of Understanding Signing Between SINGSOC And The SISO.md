### **Speech By Mr Seet Choh San, President, SISO, At The Memorandum Of Understanding Signing Between Singapore Southeast Asian Games Organising Committee (SINGSOC) And The Singapore Institution Of Satety Officers (SISO)**

Mr Lim Teck Yin, SINGSOC EXCO Chairman

SNOC and SINGSOC partners,

Members of the media and the safety community,

Fellow Safety Professionals,

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Good morning.

2. It is with great excitement that SISO can partner with the SINGSOC to look into the safety aspects of the 28th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Singapore. This partnership will see the development and implementation of risk management plans for the 28th SEA Games and will contribute towards a safe 28th SEA Games.

3. More than 80 SISO members, who are qualified Workplace Safety and Health Officers, will fan across the island over the next few months to conduct Risk Assessments of the SEA Games venues. It is just the start of the 4 phases of collaboration that will extend past the SEA Games in 2015.

4. This is not the first collaboration between SISO and the SSC. In 2009, the SSC was a co-organiser of the Safety and Health in Research and Educational (SHRE) Conference organised by SISO. SSC was also a participant in the 2010 SHRE. The participation of the SSC in the SHRE Conferences was important as the sports industry segment was to come under the Workplace Safety and Health Act in 2011. Together, the SSC and other stakeholders in this SISO conference contributed to sharing best practices in Safety and Health, and learned the technological advances and innovative ideas to get a good start in Workplace Safety and Health. We look forward to continuing such engagements with the SSC.

5. SISO has been engaging its members in many national level WSH committees and workgroups to make the difference in setting Workplace Safety and Health standards and in implementing WSH programs. Among them are the committees in the Workplace Safety and Health Council and SPRING, the authority for Singapore's standard. SISO is now pushing the envelope to contribute beyond these traditional areas through the SSC collaboration. The 28th SEA Games has, by far, the largest number of SISO members contributing to a single event. SISO members will be doing this on a pro-bono basis, and for many, at their own time and in addition to their work, family and society commitments. SISO appreciates the commitment of its volunteer members and thank them for stepping up to the need.

6. Singapore is a little island but is blessed with good leaders and cohesive people. It is said "How good and pleasant it is when people live together in unity." To this end, SISO will play its part to foster this spirit and will continue contributing back to Singapore as one team.
