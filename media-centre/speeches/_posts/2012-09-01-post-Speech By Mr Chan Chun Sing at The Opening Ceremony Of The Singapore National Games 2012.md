### **Speech By Mr Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister For Community Development, Youth And Sports And Senior Minister Of State, Ministry Of Defence, At The Opening Ceremony Of The Singapore National Games 2012**

Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong

Ladies and Gentlemen, and everyone who is here in full support for the Singapore National Games,

1. It is great to see everyone here enjoying yourselves. This is why we are here. Sport is not just for the high performers or the elites. Sport is something for everyone. We want to see sport being used to develop the individual, to bond the community and to inspire the nation.

2. This is the reason why we have organized the Singapore National Games and the Community Games, for everyone to come together and enjoy sports. It doesn't matter if you are young, old, or which walk of life you come from. All of us can come forth and be involved in the Games. I hope that you will continue to support and participate in the Games. Even if you do not participate in the Games, you can always cheer the athletes on because Sport is truly for everyone.

3. I wish all of you the very best for the coming weeks, and hope that you demonstrate the true spirit of sportsmanship. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. Most importantly, let us bond together through Sport and enjoy ourselves.

4. Thank you very much.
