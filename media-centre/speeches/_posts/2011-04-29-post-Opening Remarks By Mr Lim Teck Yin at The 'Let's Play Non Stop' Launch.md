Friends from the media

Ladies and Gentlemen

Good Afternoon.

1 Welcome to the launch of "Let's Play Non-Stop!", an exciting new programme by the Singapore Sports Council and Coca Cola Singapore designed to see more Singaporeans playing more sports. Over the coming months, you're going to find us showcasing a variety of sports in malls and sports and recreation centres across the heartlands of Singapore, thanks to this new $5 million partnership with Coca Cola Singapore.

2 The Singapore Sports Council is committed to providing opportunities for Singaporeans to live better lives through sports. Coca Cola also believes in living positively, and there is no better way than sports to lead a healthy, active lifestyle. With Let's Play Non-Stop!, you will get to try, learn and play a new sport every month. We're starting with netball, but there will be something new for you every month, thanks to this new partnership between SSC and Coca Cola.

3 We want you to make sports your first choice for fun, fitness and family time. If you already love sports, you know what I'm talking about: the fun, the satisfaction, the exhilaration of a game well-played. But SSC wants to see everyone joining the game, whether you've played before or not. Let's Play Non-Stop is your chance to try.

4 We've set up today's event so you can learn from some of the best in Singapore?the ladies from the Singapore National Netball Team. We?ve also got some celebrities lined up. So, grab a friend and Let's Play. In July, you can join us for the World Netball Championships at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

5 In the meantime, keep playing sports for fun. My best advice as a lifelong sportsman: Play with someone. Don't do it alone. Get a kaki. Whether you're trying for the first time, hoping to hit a new personal best or master a new level, it's always better to be kicking it with a friend.

6 Playing with a partner produces great success in promoting sports as much as it does in playing sports. At the Singapore Sports Council, we know we can be more effective in growing sports participation if we work with partners. Thus, we are delighted that Coca Cola is partnering with us on "Let's Play! Non-Stop".

6 Coca Cola is recognised as one of the most successful brands in the world. On facebook, almost 26 million people 'like' coke - the highest rated page on the site. Over the next five years of this partnership, we hope to leverage off Coca Cola's vast popularity and marketing experience to bring more sporting fun to people across Singapore.
