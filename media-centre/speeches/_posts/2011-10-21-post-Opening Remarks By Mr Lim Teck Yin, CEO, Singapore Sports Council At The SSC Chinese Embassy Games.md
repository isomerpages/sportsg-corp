### **Opening Remarks By Mr Lim Teck Yin, CEO, Singapore Sports Council At The SSC Chinese Embassy Games**

OPENING REMARKS BY MR LIM TECK YIN, CEO, SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL AT THE SSC-CHINESE EMBASSY GAMES
21 OCTOBER 2011, 3.20PM AT PASIR RIS SPORTS & RECREATIONAL CENTRE

Your Excellency, Mr. Wei Wei, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Singapore

Our distinguished guests from the Embassy of the People's Republic of China,

Mr. Gavin Yang, General Manager of Li Ning Singapore

Ladies and gentlemen;

A very good afternoon.

1 It gives me great pleasure to welcome all of you here to the Pasir Ris Sport and Recreational Centre (SRC), which represents the newest generation of sports centres developed by Singapore Sports Council.

2 As you have seen during the tour of our facility, the spaces we build for sport goes beyond providing our people with opportunity to play sport; our SRCs are serving to unite people from all races, genders and ages. People come to our SRCs to socialise with friends and family. To form new friendships. To have fun.

3 Likewise, in the global landscape, sport is the universal language that crosses all borders. It brings together people from different cultures and nationalities in the spirit of goodwill, harmony and diplomacy. It opens the doors for meaningful dialogue, and it offers the world a unique opportunity to discover the heart and warmth of a nation.

4 China and Singapore have had many opportunities over the years to learn more about each other through sports. In 1989 we signed a sports Memorandum of Understanding, which is still in effect today and has resulted in many mutually beneficial collaborations - in sports such as Gymnastics, Badminton, Synchonised Swimming and Sailing. I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency, Mr. Wei Wei and our counterparts from the People's Republic of China for their generosity over the years.

5 Through this sporting partnership, we have been able to enhance the capability of our athletes. And we have been able to continuing forging a harmonious relationship between our two nations.

6 Last year, Singapore and China celebrated our 20th anniversary of bilateral ties by holding the Sino-Singapore Sports Symposium in October 2010 and a friendly match between Jiangsu provincial badminton team & Team Singapore in November 2010. Organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and the General Administration of Sports of China (GAS), these collaborations were avenues for both organisations to exchange expertise and ideas.

7 Sports business and industry also have capitalised on Singapore's sound infrastructure and global connectivity. In many areas, Singapore is now an established springboard for Chinese companies looking to expand their brands regionally and globally. I want to take a moment to thank Li Ning for sponsoring the polo shirts and equipment for this evening's games. In a short period of time, Li Ning has become a fixture in the Singapore sports scene, and we are grateful for their support.

8 Building on the strong foundations laid by our predecessors over the years, I am certain that our collaborations in sport will continue to flourish in the years to come. Without further adieu, let the games begin!
