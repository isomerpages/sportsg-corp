#### **Values and Principles in Sport**
Research has shown that participation in sports is closely linked to health, well-being and the development of life skills such as problem-solving, communication, decision-making, leadership, perseverance and time management. Positive experiences in sports are associated with lifelong sports participation. As such, inculcating values and principles in sports is critical in laying the foundation for the future.

**The Values and Principles in Sports (VPS) Workshop**

A coach plays a major influence in the lives of youth because he/she is not only teaching them skills in sports, but also instilling lifelong values and principles that would mould their character and guide them in their path of development. The VPS workshop helps a coach to reflect upon one’s personal values, learn which values are beneficial to the all-rounded growth of youth and how to teach them through sports coaching.

The VPS workshop includes the following modules:

*   **Coaching philosophy** – Encourages coaches to regularly review their coaching philosophy and update it, if necessary.

*   **Philosophy and values** – Intentional design using the ['Game for Life (GFL)' framework](/sports-education/sports-leadership/game-for-life/e): discusses the performance, social and moral values defined by the framework, suitable development platforms to utilise the framework and actions required by the coach (Check-Act-Reinforce).

*   **Organisational values for coaches** – Elaborates on strategic outcomes of [Vision 2030](/about-us/vision-2030), [National Registry of Coaches’ (NROC) Code of Ethics](/support-resources/coaches-corner/coachs-code-of-ethics/), [National Standards for Youth Sports (NSYS)](/sports-education/national-standards-for-youth-sports/) and [Ministry of Education’s (MOE) 21st Century Competencies Framework and Student Outcomes](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/education-system/21st-century-competencies).

*   **Doping and positive front of sports** – Promotes understanding on doping, rationale for fighting doping, and health consequences of doping; introduces World Anti-Doping Code and Prohibited List; explains the role of a coach in anti-doping, how athletes can become vulnerable to doping and a decision-making framework for coaches when confronted with a possible scenario that may implicate doping.

In the workshop, there are opportunities to meet other sport coaches and engage in group discussions on the various VPS topics.

Note:
With effect from March 2015, the VPS workshop replaces the National Standards for Youth Sports. The VPS workshop is conducted in English.
