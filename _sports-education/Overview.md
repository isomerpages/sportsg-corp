### **Driving love for sport**

Singapore prides herself in being a melting pot of cultures - food, traditions, and even sports. The history of sport in Singapore can trace as far back as the 19th century when settlers from abroad brought their nations' sports to our shores.

Today, Singaporeans participate in an array of sports for recreation and competition, from football to tennis to cricket, to name a few. To keep Singapore's sports scene vibrant, Sport Singapore commits itself to give Singaporeans adequate exposure to the various sports available by supporting sports communities, providing facilities, organising competitions, and inculcating love for sports from a young age.
