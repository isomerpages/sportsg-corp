Sport Singapore encourages appropriate safety and personal health measures so as to ensure a fun, invigorating and safe sporting experience.

**Personal Precautions**

Individuals are recommended to take these precautions to avoid dehydration or overheating during sports activities:  

*   Bring along a bottle of cold water or isotonic drink for any sports activity
*   Drink sufficient fluids to prevent your body from overheating; passing clear or light-coloured urine is a sign that you are adequately hydrated
*   Avoid strong coffee or alcohol because they can cause dehydration
*   Ideally, drink about 500ml of water 30 minutes before exercise, 250ml to 500ml every half-hour during exercise and 1000ml after exercise
*   Isotonic or sports drinks are also recommended for any activity that lasts more than an hour

**Environmental Considerations**

The environment should be safe and suitable for the sport you participate in. If the sports activity involves rough waters or steep terrain, wear proper protective gear and check that you have taken all appropriate safety precautions. 

To avoid getting caught in bad weather, check the weather forecast before a sports activity. Cancel or postpone any outdoor activity if there are signs of lightning. If you are caught in stormy weather, seek shelter immediately. 

**Sports Equipment**

Wearing protective sports gear and using the correct sports equipment reduces the risk of injury and harm. Examples of protective gear include helmets for cyclists and shin guards for soccer or hockey players.

**Before & After**

To keep yourself injury-free, ensure that you have a proper warm-up and cool down before and after any sports activity. 

Warm-up and stretching exercises prepare your mind, heart, muscles and joints for higher levels of exertion during a sports activity. They also improve performance and prevent injuries. 

Cardiovascular exercises involving your heart, lungs and leg muscles, such as jogging, brisk walking or jumping jacks, can help you to warm up. 

All sporting activities should end with static stretching and cool-down exercises to loosen muscles and reduce discomfort and soreness.

**Fair Play**

Understand the rules of the game, employ proper techniques and engage in fair play to reduce the risk of injuring yourself or harming others. 

**Essential Skills**

First Aid, Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) certification are essential skills that will come in useful during critical situations.

Everyone is encouraged to equip themselves with such emergency response skills. 

**Nutrition**

The Health Diet Pyramid is a guide to help you plan a well-balanced daily diet. 

Adults are recommended to consume more servings of items from the Pyramid’s lower tiers and fewer servings of items from its upper tiers:   

*   Rice & alternatives (5-7 servings)
*   Fruit & vegetables (2 servings each)
*   Meat & alternatives (2-3 servings)
*   Fats, oil, salt and sugar (sparingly)
