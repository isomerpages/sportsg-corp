Sport Singapore and its relevant ActiveSG sports facilities have in place a protocol to ensure the well-being of its guests, patrons and staff. All ActiveSG sports facilities will take the necessary action to adjust its operational hours and programmes to limit the ill effects from haze exposure.

The closure of sports facilities will be based on 24-hour PSI readings.
