Sports Safety is integral in our promotion of a sporting culture among Singaporeans. In 2007, the Sports Safety Committee released a comprehensive report with detailed findings on sports safety standards and systems aligned with international best practices to the public. A review of the report was also carried out by the committee as part of its continuous improvement efforts in 2014.

In 2016, the Sports Safety Committee reconvene with the scope of water safety subsumed under the Committee.

The Sports Safety Committee is jointly chaired by Dr Benedict Tan, (designation) and Chief Lai Chin Kwang (designation). The Sports Safety Committee Members are appointed by SportSG for a term of 2-years (8 Sept 2016 – 8 Sept 2018) renewable at the end of the term.
