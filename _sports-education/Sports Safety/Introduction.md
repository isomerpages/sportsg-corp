The Sports Safety Working Committee was formed in the first quarter of 2008 and comprises Sport Singapore and 14 organisations that manage mass sports events and operate sports venues as well as medical institutions. The Committee aims to promote sports safety in Singapore holistically through a multi-year, multi-prong Sports Safety Plan.

In detail, the Sports Safety Working Committee: 
*   Studies implementation issues 
*   Puts into operation the recommendations of the Sports Safety Committee
*   Promotes sports safety across different sports
*   Assists NSAs in developing and implementing sports safety practices and various information, materials, guides and templates for the public 

Below is a report on the 'OVERVIEW AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPORTS SAFETY IN SINGAPORE'   
done by the Sports Safety Committee.

The Sport Safety Committee Report 2019 has since been translated into a Singapore Standard, SS681:2022 Code of Practice for Sport Safety
