Sports Safety is integral in our promotion of a sporting culture among Singaporeans. In 2007, the Sport Safety Committee released a comprehensive report with detailed findings on sports safety standards and systems aligned with international best practices to the public. Since then, the report had undergone further reviews in 2014 and 2019. 

The 2019 Sport Safety Committee Report provides practical guidelines and international best practices to improve sport safety. They cover a wide range of settings, including competitive and school sport, recreation, and fitness activities, and addresses the risks and challenges to good safety practice that we have encountered in recent years. The Report advocates a strong proactive approach to managing risks, especially with the desire to increase sport participation across all demographics. 

The 2019 Sport Safety Committee Report was subsequently translated into Singapore Standard SS681: 2022 Code of Practice for Sport Safety. 

Since then, the following Singapore Standards were also developed:

SS700:2023 Code of Practice for Water Safety - Aquatic Facilities

SS701:2024 Code of Practice for Inland and Open Water Sporting Activities
