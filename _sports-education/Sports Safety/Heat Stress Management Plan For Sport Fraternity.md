<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2016, the Homefront (i.e., ministries/statutory boards) has relied
on a Heatwave Contingency Plan that was based on temperatures reaching
up to 35°C over a prolonged period. &nbsp;However, learning from the severity
of 2022’s heatwave episodes in Europe and China and more severe climate
change projections, MSE has formed a workgroup comprising representatives
from MOE, MOH, MOM, NEA, MCCY, PA, SportSG, to review and align contingency
plans for the Homefront. SportSG has since updated the Heat Stress Management
Plan for reference and use by the sports fraternity.</p>
<p><strong>Climate Change</strong>
</p>
<p>Many countries in the world including Singapore, are seeing rising temperatures.
According to NEA, the last ten years from 2013 to 2022 was Singapore’s
warmest decade on record. On 13 May 2023, Ang Mo Kio recorded a 37 degrees
Celsius air temperature, similar to the record set on 17 April 1983. It
is therefore important for the sporting fraternity to prepare and adapt
to rising temperatures. This Plan aims to help the sporting fraternity
better prepare, plan and respond during severe hot weather and reduce heat
injury risks in sport. It also provides information for persons participating
in outdoor activities especially during heightened levels of heat stress.</p>
