<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Based on Singapore’s Third National Climate Change (V3) projections coupled
with Singapore’s long term temperature records, there is a clear warming
trend brought on by climate change. In addition, we also see climate drivers
like the El Nino driving higher temperatures in Singapore from time to
time. Therefore, whole of government has been stepping up heat response
measures, including the launch of the heat stress advisory (HSA) in April
2023 which is a jointly managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA),
Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Workplace
Safety and Health Council (WSHC). This advisory system provides the public
with information about heat stress risk levels and recommended precautionary
measures to raise awareness of heat stress and provide the public with
real-time information. The public can access these advisories through the
myENV mobile app or the NEA website, helping them plan outdoor activities
and take appropriate precautions during periods of high heat stress risk.</p>
<p><strong>Climate Change</strong>
</p>
<p>It is therefore important for the sporting fraternity to prepare and adapt
to rising temperatures. This Plan aims to help the sporting fraternity
better prepare, plan and respond during severe hot weather and reduce heat
injury risks in sport. It also provides information for persons participating
in outdoor activities especially during heightened levels of heat stress.</p>
