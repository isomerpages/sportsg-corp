The **Sports Education Programme (SEP)** is a collaborative partnership between Sport Singapore (SportSG) and the Ministry of Education (MOE). Schools eligible for SEP are Primary, Secondary, Junior College, Centralised Institution and Special Education Schools. Under SEP, each school is provided with a S$10,000 dollar-to-dollar matching grant for them to take up sports programmes from an endorsed list.

The SEP aims to advocate the importance of sports education, encourage sports participation in schools and increase sporting opportunities for the young. It also serves as an integrated and structured approach to link sports service providers with schools to ensure that innovative and quality sports programmes are delivered.

Sports programmes are assessed by a panel comprising representatives from SportSG, MOE, schools, sports educators and practitioners to qualify for endorsement under the SEP.

SEP sports programmes caters for development of skills and sports knowledge of students and help promote active participation of sports in schools. The programmes also promote team spirit and character building, and aim to arouse interest in continual sports participation amongst students.
