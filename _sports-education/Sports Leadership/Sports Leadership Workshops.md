**Dates**: 12 September 2019

**Venue**: Singapore Sports Hub

**Description**: Beyond just developing technical expertise in your athletes / players, the role of a coach extends to that of a Team Builder.

Therefore the role of a coach is critical in building trust and cohesion so as to achieve high performing results. Understanding your team's dynamics will also provide you with a better sense of interventions that are required to build a positive team culture in the long run. 

The **learning outcomes** from this workshop include:

*   Gaining better awareness on team development in sport
*   Understanding how to adopt a more facilitative approach when communicating with your teams

Practical handles and experiences will be shared during the session so that you can apply your learnings back in your coaching.
