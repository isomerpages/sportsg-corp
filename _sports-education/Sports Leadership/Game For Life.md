Sport offers a parallel pathway to success as it helps people develop the skills sets and principles valued by society. Sport can be a powerful vehicle if it is designed, structured and delivered with care and forethought. Sport Singapore developed the **Game For Life Toolkit** that features the use of game activities and specific role playing for the learning and development of performance, social and moral values and attributes. This enables training, education and coaching professionals to **create**teachable moments, where learning values can be infused into any sporting experience for every individual.

**Game For Life Toolkit comprises:**
* [Game For Life Book - 25 Journeys](/sport-leadership/game-for-life/book/)
* [Game For Life - Guide to developing character and leadership through sport](/sport-leadership/game-for-life/guide/)

**Why should I be equipped with the Game For Life Toolkit?**
The Game For Life Toolkit provides training, education and coaching to professionals looking to instil life-skills and values through sports. Corporations and educational institutions will be equipped with future skill sets and principles.

**Who is the toolkit suitable for?**
* Coaches
* Physical and Sport Educators
* Youth Sport Providers
* Corporate Training Professionals
* All who subscribe to sport as a platform for character and leadership development

**Effectiveness of Game For Life Toolkit**

To determine whether the Game For Life Toolkit was effective in values inculcation, Sport Singapore conducted an impact analysis that employed a combination of a treatment-control and pre-post research design over a school term of approximately 10 weeks.

The Game For Life (GFL) Community of Practice (CoP) was started in 2016 which brings together sport educators and coaches to share best practices on Character and Leadership Development through Sport (CLDS). The purpose of the GFL CoP is to provide a platform for coaches and sport educators to continue upskilling themselves to achieve outcomes in the affective domain by learning from one another and subject matter experts.

The GFL CoP is for any sport educator (eg. PE teacher) and coach who has a keen interest in CLDS (eg. values inculcation in sport) and is currently also implementing CLDS practices in his/her teaching/coaching. The Game For Life CoP is also for any previous participant of the Game For Life workshop who would like to continue learning about CLDS.
