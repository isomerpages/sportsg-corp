<p>Sport offers a parallel pathway to success as it helps people develop
the skills sets and principles valued by society. Sport can be a powerful
vehicle if it is designed, structured and delivered with care and forethought.
Sport Singapore developed the&nbsp;<strong>Game For Life Toolkit</strong>&nbsp;that
features the use of game activities and specific role playing for the learning
and development of performance, social and moral values and attributes.
This enables training, education and coaching professionals to&nbsp;<strong>create </strong>teachable
moments, where learning values can be infused into any sporting experience
for every individual.</p>

<p>The Game For Life (GFL) Community of Practice (CoP) was started in 2016
which brings together sport educators and coaches to share best practices
on Character and Leadership Development through Sport (CLDS). The purpose
of the GFL CoP is to provide a platform for coaches and sport educators
to continue upskilling themselves to achieve outcomes in the affective
domain by learning from one another and subject matter experts. Past sessions
of some GFL CoP sessions are recorded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Sports-Education/Sports-Leadership/Latest" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Who is the GFL CoP for?</strong>
</p>
<p>The GFL CoP is for any sport educator (eg. PE teacher) and coach who has
a keen interest in CLDS (eg. values inculcation in sport) and is currently
also implementing CLDS practices in his/her teaching/coaching. The Game
For Life CoP is also for any previous participant of the Game For Life
workshop who would like to continue learning about CLDS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community of Practice Sessions are organised about twice a year.</p>
