First organised in 1962 by the then Ministry of Culture, the Grand Prix was first known as the Malaysia Grand Prix. It was one of Singapore's major sporting attractions. 

The name changed to Singapore Grand Prix in 1966 after Singapore attained its independence. The event was discontinued in 1974 due to the increase in traffic and the inconvenience of having to close several roads for it. A plan to relocate the circuit also fell through and finally; a fatal accident at the Grand Prix sealed its fate.
