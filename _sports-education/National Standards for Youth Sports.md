The youth of today is tomorrow’s future. Sport Singapore believes in equipping the youth of today with the right attitudes, skills and knowledge as the foundation for their future. Through a sustainable and supportive sporting community for youth, guided by the National Standards for Youth Sports (NSYS), our youth will maximise their potential through sports participation, and grow with the values that will see them well into their adult years. 

The NSYS is established to ensure that youth sports in Singapore is organised and delivered in a healthy and wholesome environment for our youth, while issues such as violence, abuse and other unsporting behaviours are kept at bay.
