<p>The <strong>Sports Education Programme (SEP)</strong> is a collaborative
partnership between Sport Singapore (SportSG) and the Ministry of Education
(MOE). Schools eligible for SEP are Primary, Secondary, Junior College,
Centralised Institution and Special Education Schools. Under SEP, each
school is provided with a S$10,000 dollar-to-dollar matching grant for&nbsp;them
to take up sports programmes from an endorsed list.</p>
<p>The SEP aims to advocate the importance of sports education, encourage
sports participation in schools and increase sporting opportunities for
the young. It also serves as an integrated and structured approach to link
sports service providers with schools to ensure that innovative and quality
sports programmes are delivered.</p>
<p>Sports programmes are assessed by a panel comprising representatives from
SportSG, MOE, schools, sports educators and practitioners to qualify for
endorsement under the SEP.</p>
<p>SEP sports programmes caters for development of&nbsp;skills and sports
knowledge&nbsp;of students and help promote active participation of sports
in schools. The programmes also&nbsp;promote team spirit and character
building, and aim to arouse interest in continual sports participation
amongst students.</p>
