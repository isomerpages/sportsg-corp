The **Sports Education Programme (SEP)** is a collaborative partnership between Sport Singapore (SportSG) and the Ministry of Education (MOE). Schools eligible for SEP are Primary, Secondary, Junior College, Centralised Institution and Special Education Schools. Under SEP, each school is provided with a S$10,000 dollar-to-dollar matching grant for them to take up sports programmes from an endorsed list.

The SEP aims to advocate the importance of sports education, encourage sports participation in schools and increase sporting opportunities for the young. It also serves as an integrated and structured approach to link sports service providers with schools to ensure that innovative and quality sports programmes are delivered.

Sports programmes are assessed by a panel comprising representatives from SportSG, MOE, schools, sports educators and practitioners to qualify for endorsement under the SEP.

SEP sports programmes caters for development of skills and sports knowledge of students and help promote active participation of sports in schools. The programmes also promote team spirit and character building, and aim to arouse interest in continual sports participation amongst students.

### **Coach Criteria**

**1. NROC SPORTS**

Sports Providers offering [NROC Sports](/coaches-corner/singapore-coach-excellence/sg-coach-technical-programme-accreditation/) will need to have their instructors/coaches registered under the National Registry of Coaches (NROC). During the two-year endorsement period, instructors/coaches will also be invited to attend clinics, workshops, and conferences as part of the NROC requirement on continuing education (CCE).  
  
For application details on NROC, please visit [NROC Registration](/support-resources/activesg-programme-partnership/nroc-sports/).

Sports service providers will be required to submit your coaches’ relevant technical certificate equivalent if your coaches are not equipped with NCAP Technical Level 1.

**b. NCAP / SG-Coach Theory Courses**

Coaches and instructors will be required to complete either the NCAP Theory or SG-Coach Theory course. The [SG-Coach Programme](/support-resources/coaches-corner/singapore-coach-excellence-sg-coach-programme/) replaces the NCAP.

**3. VALUES AND PRINCIPLES IN SPORTS (VPS)**

With effect from March 2015, the National Standards for Youth Sports (NSYS) workshops will be replaced by the Values and Principles in Sports (VPS) workshops.

Apart from covering key content from the previous NSYS course, the new VPS workshop will also enable participants to develop their own personal coaching philosophies, design sports programmes with the ‘Game of Life’ Framework and leverage values and attributes to develop of a successful sports team.

Please take note that attendees of the previously offered ‘NSYS for Coaching in Singapore Schools” (NSYS) workshop are deemed to have fulfilled Ministry of Education’s (MOE) requirements for registration of all sports coaches and instructors in schools and they do not need to attend the new VPS workshop. Coaches who had completed modules 1-3 in the previous NSYS will be required to sign up for a bridging workshop with MOE on the fourth module to fulfill MOE’s requirements.  

The new VPS workshop is one of the six topics under the Singapore Coach Excellence (SG-Coach) Theory Level One Programme and exemption of attendance from the VPS can be sought.
